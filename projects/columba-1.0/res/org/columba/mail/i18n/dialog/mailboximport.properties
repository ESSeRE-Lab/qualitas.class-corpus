Evolution_description = You can find the config folder under \"~/evolution/local/yourfolder\". Just replace \"yourfolder\" with the mailbox you are searching (for example Inbox, Drafts or Trash). In this folder you will find a file which is named \"mbox\". This is your mailbox.
Mozilla_description = On *nix flavors you can find the config folder in your home-directory, under \"~/.mozilla\". Then have a look in \"default/identity/Mail/Local Folders. Replace \"identity\" with what you find under default. My identiy is for example \"3kzzoiv9.slt\". In this directory you can find files named like your folders (for example Inbox, Drafts, or Trash). These are your mailboxes.
PegasusMail_description = First, you need to make sure that your Pegasus mail data is in the UNIX mbox format. To do so, check the folder properties in the Folders-Dialog in Pegasus Mail. If it is not, create a new folder with the UNIX mail format, and copy all the messages in the folder to the new one. In your Pegasus mail directory, you should now have a file of the name format UNX?????.MBX Where ? are numbers from 0-9. This is the actual message box.
