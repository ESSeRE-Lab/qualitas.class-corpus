Swing Menus get generated using customizable XML configuration files
<p>
org.columba.core.action.menu.xml defines the core menu, mail and addressbook
define their own menu.xml, which extend the core menu. 
<p>
We therefore added placeholders we called <b>extensionpoint</b>, which 
are used by mail/addressbook to address the location where they plug 
themselves in the core menu.
<p>
Note, that the swing menu code is kept separated from the code which actually
creates the menu - the generator classes.
<p>
{@link MenuPluginHandler} is responsible to handle all the plugins.
