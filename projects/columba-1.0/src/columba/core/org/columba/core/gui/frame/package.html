Model-View-Controller based frame package.

All components use this package to which creates a simple frame with basic
menu, toolbar and statusbar. Mail and addressbook plug themselves in this
frame and provide customized functionality.

It would be a good idea to provide a framework, which distinguishs 
multiview from singleview frames. Depending on what you like you could
just extend the correct class.
