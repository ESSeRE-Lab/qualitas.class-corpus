Very simple sax-based XML configuration backend.

A more complete example on using the backend:

<pre>
// use a path-like navigation to get the interesting option
// first part is getting the file "options.xml" from the "mail" directory (MailOptions)
// we also have the same for addressbook -> AddressbookOptions
// second part address the xml-treenode "/options/gui/html"
XmlElement preferHtml = MailConfig.get("options").getElement("/options/gui/html");

// register as observer
preferHtml.addObserver(this);

// example of getting a property
String enableHtml = preferHtml.getAttribute("enable"); 
</pre>

</body>
