Online help framework using JavaHelp.
<p>

<h3>Adding context-specific help to a button</h3>
<pre>
 HelpManager.enableHelpOnButton(helpButton, "configuring_columba");
</pre>
This associates the help button (JButton) with the topic ID. 

<h3>Looking up topic ID</h3>

See the file jhelpmap.jhm, which associates topic IDs with html files.
All files can be found in package lib/usermanual.jar.
<p>
I've used a very general schema to generate topic IDs.
Following a couple of examples, so you don't need to lookup every
single topic ID:
<ul>
 <li>index -> index (index.html)</li>
 <li>introduction -> introduction (ch01.html) </li>
 <li>installation -> installing (ch02.html) </li>
 <li>installation_1 -> installating-windows (ch02.html)</li>
 <li>installation_2 -> installating-linux (ch02_2.html)</li>
 <li>installation_3 -> installating-generic (ch02_3.html)</li>
 <li>using_columba_composing_new_email_messages_2 -> composing new email messages (ch04s03.html)</li>
</ul>

Note that subsections are numbered where sections have names. The last 
examples is a very interesting one:
"using_columba" -> section
"composing_new_email_messages" ->first subsection
"2" ->second subsection

Hope you get the idea!
