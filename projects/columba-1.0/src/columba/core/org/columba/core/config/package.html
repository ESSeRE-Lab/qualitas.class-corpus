XML-based configuration management.

All config files are registered at {@link Config}.
<p>
{@link MailConfig} and {@link AddressbookConfig} are just helper classes which register
their configuration files at {@link Config}. This can be seen in the configuration directory
structure of the user's configuration directory. Where mail and addressbook have their
own folders for storing preferences.
<p> 
 Example on how to get a {@link XmlElement}xml treenode:
  
  <pre>
  
  XmlElement gui = MainInterface.config.get(&quot;options&quot;).getElement(&quot;/options/gui&quot;);
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  This would address the file <b>options.xml </b>. Following a little example
  on how this file would look like:
  <p>
  
  <pre>
  
   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;options&gt;
     &lt;gui enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
      .. your options here
     &lt;/gui&gt;
    &lt;/options&gt;
   
  </pre>
