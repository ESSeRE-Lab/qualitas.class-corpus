Provides commands for accessing the mailbox stores.
<p>
Folder shouldn't be accessed directly. Instead we use {@link FolderCommand}, which
in conjunction with {@link FolderCommandReference} provide a looking facility.
This makes sure that only one {@link Command} at a time can modify the folder's
data.
<p>
As explained in org.columba.command, {@link DefaultProcessor} is  a preclaiming
schedular. FolderCommandReference keeps a list of folders involved in
the operation the Command executes. DefaultProcessor will only start
the Command if all folders (resources) can be claimed at once.
