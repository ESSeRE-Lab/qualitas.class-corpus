Provides all abstract classes for a folder-orentiented datastorage.

<p>
Every folder class subclasses {@link FolderTreeNode}, which is basically only
a mutable treenode, which uses the tree.xml configuration file as {@link TreeModel}.
</p>

<p>
Unlike {@link FolderTreeNode} which doesn't contain messages, {@link Folder} should
be subclasses by every mailbox.
</p>

<p>
{@link LocalFolder} is used by all local folders and builds a plugin-like approach
to make it easy to add new mailbox formats in the futue.
</p>

<p>
{@link FolderFactory} follows the factory pattern in providing methods to create
new folders.
