Columba v1.0 

Bug fixes:
- TreeSelection after Popup fixed. The problem was that the boolean flags to check
  if this event is popup-event must be reset to false after the menu is shown.
- Refactored MarkAsReadTimer. It is now independant of the TableController which 
  makes more sense. It works with the util Timer to avoid execting an add to 
  the CommandProcess in the EventDispatcherThread. It fixes unwanted MarkAsRead 
  when the messagepreview is hidden.
- #958065 sort order, when changing columns. ColumnHeaderTable model should be 
  listener to tablecolumnmodel
- Small bug in synchronization of HeaderLists: Deleted local uids were not 
  counted in the message balance. This resulted in a complete sync which is 
  not necessary.
- Minor IMAP tweaks to get more performance/nicer connection handling.
- Flags and Attributes need to be cloned when used as parameters in the 
  addMessage method.
- Headerlist was not instantiated when new subfolders were created.
- Virtual Folder now also does binning on innerCopy and MarkMessage. Huge
  speedup for large copy/move/delete commands on VirtualFolders.
- All IMAPFolders can now be synced by the checkmail action.
- #1281648, edit in external editor doesn't work
- #1281632, edit group dialog doesn't let you add new contacts
- use interfaces for selection handling where possible, improved package 
  dependencies 
- cleanup of gui.toolbar package, resembling the extendable menu code
- #1276646, Selection in Copy Messag Dialog
- #1275847 Mark as read after N seconds has no effect. Issues fixed.
- Default Account should be seleted in the Composer instead of the first account.
- Charset Menu fixes. There are not as many charsets available as 
  previously assumed.
- Do decoding of message body streams
- Handle too long Strings when writing headercache.
- Refactoring of the HeaderCacheFramework. Now HeaderList and its persistance 
  are transparently handled. Now we can even start looking into using
  BerkelyDB in the future. Unplanned (but not unwelcome), this refactoring
  also includes some IMAP speedups :-)
- make sure that message list and message viewer are cleared, if no 
  folder or message selected
- fixed composer layout, component height should be the same in every row
- replace all AbstractFolder class references with interface IMailFolder
- Speedup of MessageViewing: Use a static instance of DateTimeFormater 
  instead of reinstantiating every time.
- when changing folder selections, sometimes the row selection was set, 
  but wasn't visible. In this case, the scrollpane wasn't changed correctly
- folder options were executed twice, when selecting folder
- JTextComponent undo/redo works correctly again
- signature viewer uses same message viewer-like box style now, added 
  "edit signature..." button, now visually more separated from text editor.
- fixed table cellrenderer, selection foreground/background color
- #1256120 Save as Draft should not append signature. 
- refactored chat example plugin to remove cyclic dependencies, 
  added api/ source folder (first test of using multiple source folders in a plugin) - works perfectly ;-)
- removed all cyclic dependencies from core (columba) package
- #1250862, add menuitem to view the error log file
- #1250951, wrong font color in message list component (still, 
  the extension interface is too complicated, going to simplify later)
- fixed pending resource loader problem. This works now correctly. 
  See chat.altura plugin for examples on how to load resources. 
  "this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(String str)" does the trick.
- fine-tune default theme settings
- updated winlaf look and feel (jdic project containing bugfixes to make 
  the JDK win L&F look more native)
- Added native support for Mac application and web browser open.
- added new recipient list autocomplete textfield
- Performance tuned mbox importer.
- Add a default signature when creating a new account.
- Messages are marked as deleted before moved to trash. Now Expunge 
  Folders works as users expect it to on the trash folder.
- Handle multiparts in the alternative part. Ignore charset of HMTLDocument.
- refactored plugin system, refactored menu extension system
- Refactoring and clean-up for platfrom independence. From this commit 
  on, all not natively supported platforms are again supported.
  I have created default fallbacks for the mime association and the trayicon
  features. It is now also easier to integrate the mac features with their native jars.
- Html to Text was not charset aware.
- Image Viewer speedup: Use the FAST scaling method instead of smooth.
- Added a new edit Signature action. This opens the external text editor 
  to edit the Signature. Can be run from Identitypanel or Composer. I also
  added the MailAccount configuration to the Composer menu.
- Virtual Folder speedup: Packed searches instead of every single for its 
  own. Also fixed some problems with recursive VFolders.
- selection handling changed. If you open the context-menu, the selection 
  changes will not trigger the message viewer. This works for the tree and 
  the message list.
- #958067,cut/copy/paste messages throws exception fixed
- Added more information on the messageFlagedChanged event. With this
  additional information it is now possible to update the VFolders 
  correctly if the flags change. Further, a new search is triggered if the 
  flags change so that the VFolders get these changes. There is still a good 
  way missing for removing messages after a Flag change.

      instead of the real hostname. This should fix problems with 
      TCP-tunneling, NAT (IP Masquerading in Linux), and hosts without 
      fully qualified domainname (Eduardo P???rez)
    * Fixed imap folder bug, which prevented INBOX from appearing (Frederik)
    * Changed imap folder hierarchy parser. The delimiter character isn't 
      hardcoded anymore. This fixes the folder hierarchy view for cyrus 
      imapd. (Frederik)
    * Imap serverside copying/moving/deleting operates on all messages at 
      once, instead of sending a command for every message. (Frederik)
    * Fixed imap headerlist synchronization bug (Frederik)
    * Imap headercache-file is regenerated automatically on startup, 
      if corrupted. (Frederik)
    * Imap adding/removing folders now correctly un-/subscribes folder 
      automatically. This fixes a problem with uw-imapd server, 
      which showed folders as subscribed even if they didn't 
      exist anymore. (Frederik)
    * Fixed a outbox-folder bug, which prevented sending mails, if you 
      didn't selected it at some time before. (Frederik)
    * Added AUTH PLAIN SMTP authentication method.
    * Changed the smtp-authenticate default behaviour. Columba tries to 
      use ESMTP now, if the user wants to, even if the CAPABILITY response 
      didn't comply to RFC.
    * Applying filters is know blazingly fast (Timo)
    * Fixed a threading bug, which made the gui-worker freeze. A worker 
      can now be cancelled, which automatically cancels the corresponding 
      worker on the other end of the channel. (Timo)



Version 0.9.7
   
   - ported to JDK1.4
   - no more need for jaxp.jar/parser.jar packages (just do a 
     "java org.columba.main.Main",no classpath modification needed) 
   - you can use now one config-folder for different operation systems
   - default behavior for "reply"-action is know to show the message inline
   - added "reply as attachment"
   - added "forward inline"
   - added "open message in composer" action
   - in the composer you can save a message as draft or template
   - you can open now multiple instances of the composer frame
   - added "send later" action
   - fixes attachment encoding/decoding bug
   - fixed some gui bugs (treeviewer, attachmentviewer)

   

Version 0.9.6
    
    * imap subscribe/unsubscribe-dialog works now correctly
    * implemented imap server-side searching (you can now apply filters on 
      imap folders and especially use VFolders)
    * added POP-before-SMTP (SMTP-after-POP) authentification to mail sending
    * fixed some pop3 synchronization bugs





Version 0.9.5

This release finally fixed those POP3 authentification problems people had. 
We have to thank James Beam for his extraordinary help on this subject. 
But we have also added some new features:

    * POP3 mailchecking plays a soundfile when new messages arrive
    * new options for POP3 mailchecking to enable/disable automatic message 
      downloading
    * serverside IMAP copying/moving/deleting of messages
    * when downloading bodytext or mimepart from IMAP server you can now 
      see the download progress
    * bodytext doesn't get fetched twice times from IMAP server anymore



Version 0.9.4

This is a minor bugfix release. We had complains from people who couldn't 
authenticate via POP3. So I hope this version fixes the problem.
Also added a small feature: if you reply or forward a message it gets 
marked as replied.




Version 0.9.3

This is a *must have* release. We fixed some very serious bugs and added some 
mailing-list specific features. So if you are not already subscribed to our

      folders (Timo)

    * added Message-ID, In-Reply-To and References headers - we need these for 
      message threading (Frederik)
    * fixed some pop3-remote-control bugs (Frederik)



Version 0.9.2

    * fixed a translation bug, which prevented Columba from starting
    * fixed a pop3 mail fetch bug

            raw text Viewer (fast), or you choose the Advanced Viewer which

            a html viewer for html messages.
    * POP3:
          * message download size limit implemented
          * added a remote server control window. You can easily see what

            and remove and fetch them individually.
          * added the interval message checking feature
          * better compatibility with older servers which do not support APOP
    * IMAP:
          * added folder adding, removing and renaming
          * messages can be copied, moved, deleted and marked
          * added subscribe folder dialog
    * Filters:
          * added much more filter options like body, date, size, etc.
          * filters now run non-blocking
          * much improved filter dialog
    * We added PGP support this time (VERY unstable). You need the commandline 
      GnuPG for this to work:
          * encryption/decryption works
          * signing/verifying doesn't work yet
