 * A CustomMungerFactory is used to create ShadowMungers and/or ConcreteTypeMungers so that an extender can extract extra
 * information during the weaving process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A CustomMungerFactory is assigned to a weaver through its AjCompiler in extenders' code, and gets invoked by the weaver right
 * before the weaving starts. The custom shadow/type mungers being created will be added into the shadow/type munger list in the
 * weaver and participate the weaving process. For example, the match method of each custom shadow munger will be called against
 * each shadow.
