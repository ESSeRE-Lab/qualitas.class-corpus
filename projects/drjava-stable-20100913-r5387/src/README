QuickStart Guide For Building DrJava
  by Corky Cartwright (cork@rice.edu)

The following guide presumes that you already have the following
software systems installed on your system and accessible via your 
shell search path:

* Java 5.0 or 6.0 SDK, 
* subversion (svn) 1.4 or above, and 
* ant 1.7 or above.

If not, follow the instructions at http://www.drjava.org/devdocs/ for
setting up a DrJava development environment.

1) Make a directory to be the top-level container for you drjava code
   tree.  I recommend "dj".

2) Descend into this new directory by typing the command

   cd ~/dj

3) Download the drjava source code base by typing the command

   svn co https://drjava.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/drjava/trunk/drjava

4) After this download completes, descend into the root directory of
   the dowloaded code base by typing the command

   cd drjava

5) To compile the code base and generate a jar file containing the
   compiled program, enter the command

   ant jar

   which builds a jar filed named drjava.jar

If the build is successful, you can execute the built program by
entering the command

  java -jar drjava.jar

If you encounter any problems, consult the Developer Docs at
drjava.org by visiting http://www.drjava.org/devdocs/.
