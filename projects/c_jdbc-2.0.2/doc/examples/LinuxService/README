CJDBC meets daemontools.

(From http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html)

Daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.
Supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the service if
it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise needs is a directory 
with a run script that runs the service.

Multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally timestamps 
each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines matching specified 
patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the amount of disk space used.
If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries again, without losing any data. 

For more information on how the cjdbc daemontools scripts work see:
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#runlog

This dir contains few files:

cjdbc.ctrl - a sample script to start cjdbc.
cjdbc/run - run script for cjdbc. (see above)
cjdbc/log/run - run script for multilog. 
				(see http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html) 
cjdbc/env:
	o	CJDBC_HOME	- contains cjdbc home directory - /opt/cjdbc
	o 	JAVA_HOME	- contains java home directory - /opt/java
	o	ctrlcfg		- cjdbc controller config file - CJDBC_HOME/config/ctrl.cfg
	o	uid			- restrict cjdbc to run under specific UID - cjdbc.

Good luck!
