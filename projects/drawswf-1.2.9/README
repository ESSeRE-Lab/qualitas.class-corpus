1. Info
-------

This is a simple drawing application written in Java.
The drawing can be exported as an animated SWF file.
It is tested to run with Java2 1.4. Java 1.3.1. is no longer supported!
To write the flash file the JavaSWF2 is used 
(see JavaSWF2-BSD.LICENSE.txt or http://www.anotherbigidea.com/javaswf/index.html).

We use the kunstoff L&F provided by http://www.incors.org to make our gui look
nicer. The Kunstoff L&F is licenced under the GPL. 

The icons are provided by http://sf.net/projects/icons-collection which are released
