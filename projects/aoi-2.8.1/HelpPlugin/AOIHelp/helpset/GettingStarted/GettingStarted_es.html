described in detail below. &nbsp;The side panels are dockable so that

View Windows</FONT></FONT></STRONG><BR><BR>The 4 windows in the main
part of the screen show different views of the scene. By default, the
two upper windows and the lower left window show parallel or
orthogonal views of the front, side and top respectively and the
lower right window shows a perspective view from the
currently-selected camera. These views can be easily altered using
the drop-down menus at the top of each view window.<BR><BR>The window
with 'focus' or the selected window is the one with the thicker
outline (the upper left window in the example screenshot above). This
is relevant for any operations that work on single view windows. To
change the selected window, simply move the cursor to the required
window and click.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>All view windows can be panned, zoomed
and rotated independently using the camera controls:

<FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="tahoma"><BR><BR><BR>If there is more than
one camera in the scene, it is possible to see the view from any of
them by selecting the appropriate one from the drop down list.<BR><BR>If
you find it easier to work with one large window, select <B>Scene -&gt;
One View </B>from the top menu bar and the currently selected window
will fill the workspace.<BR><BR>One other thing that you need to know
is the orientation of the coordinate system used, as this varies
between 3D programs. Art of Illusion uses a right-handed coordinate
system - when the positive x-axis points right and the positive
y-axis points up, the positive z-axis points out of the monitor. If
you are facing front, the y-axis is up and down, x is left and right
and z is forward and backward. The axes for the default viewports are
thus as follows:<BR><IMG SRC="images/orientations.jpg" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=708 HEIGHT=544 BORDER=0>
<BR>Sometimes it is useful to be able to quickly visualise the whole
scene or a selected object within the view windows. This is achieved
through <B>Scene -&gt; Frame Selection with Camera</B>, which adjusts
the zoom and centering of the non-camera view windows so that the
selected objects just fit within them, and <B>Scene -&gt; Frame Scene
with Camera </B>which similarly fits the whole scene into the
windows.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR="#ff6633">3 Display
Mode</FONT></FONT></STRONG><BR><BR>There are 5 possible ways in which
to view the scene in real time: <B>Wireframe</B> preview, <B>Shaded</B>
preview, <B>Smooth</B> preview, <B>Textured</B> preview and
<B>Transparent</B> preview. The type of preview is selected from the
top menu bar <B>Scene -&gt; Display Mode -&gt;
Wireframe/Shaded/Smooth/Textured/Transparent</B> and affects the view
window with 'focus'. The difference between them is shown in the
figure below: <BR><BR><IMG SRC="images/previews.jpg" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0>
<BR><BR>The choice of preview mode affects performance of real time
camera movements with speed potentially decreasing from Wireframe -&gt;
Shaded -&gt; Smooth -&gt; Textured. Depending on the specifications
on the computer being used, this will be more noticeable on complex
scenes. The preview type can be set independently for each view
window.<BR><BR>Note that Shaded and Smooth previews show colours
which match, albeit in a simplistic way, the textures assigned to
each object. The Textured preview gives a much closer representation
of the actual textures.<BR><BR><BR><BR><STRONG><FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR="#ff6633">4

List</FONT></B> is a list of all the objects, including cameras and
lights, in the scene. Objects can be selected from this list for
editing simply by clicking on them. To select more than one object,
hold down the &lt;ctrl&gt; key while clicking or, to select a range,
click on an object and &lt;shift&gt; click on another to select all
the objects in between.<BR><BR>Some types of object (e.g. curves,
splines and meshes) allow editing additional to the standard move,
scale and rotate. Double-clicking on objects in the Object List opens
up the relevant editing tool.<BR><BR>This list also allows the
hierarchical arrangement of objects so that a number of objects can
be 'children' of other objects. Moving, scaling and rotating 'parent'
objects can result in the children objects also being transformed
depending on the tool setting. An object can be made a child of
another object by clicking on it and dragging it underneath the
intended parent. An arrowed bar shows the position of the object in
the list. Indentation of this bar indicates that the object can
become a child of the object above it in the list. Releasing the
mouse button causes this to happen and the parent object then has a
down arrow displayed next to it to indicate this hierarchy. Clicking
on this arrow hides the children and the arrow changes to a right
pointing arrow.<BR><BR>Arranging a parent-child hierarchy between
objects can also be useful during animation.</FONT></FONT></P>

Using Template Images</FONT></FONT></STRONG><BR><BR>Art of Illusion
allows the background of the view windows to be set to an image. This
is useful when modelling objects that benefit from a reference image.
To select an image to assign to the background, click in the view
window you want the template image to be displayed and then select
<B>Scene -&gt; Set Template Image </B>. This brings up a dialogue
allowing the choice of an image in either .jpg, .gif or .png format.
After selecting the image, it will be displayed as the background of
the selected view window.<BR><BR>To hide the image, select <B>Scene
-&gt; Hide Template </B>and to show it again select <B>Scene -&gt;
Show Template </B>. These actions can also be carried out to
hide/show template images in the various editing windows.</FONT></FONT></P>
