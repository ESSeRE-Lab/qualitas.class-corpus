	The HowTo section needs content!
	<br>The concept is for a set of small tutelets that explain how to do some of the more popular tasks that new users ask about. To keep the total HelpPlugin download within reason, each tutelet would typically have no more than 3 screen-shots, and 10 paragraphs of text.
	<br>Useful tutelets could include:
	<br>- How to setup good default lighting
	<br>- How to render a Quicktime movie
	<br>- How to group objects using the <i>null</i> object
	<br>- How to setup good indoor lighting
	<br>- How to setup good outdoor GI lighting
	<br>- How to setup an environment dome
	<br>- How to use ambient occlusion
	<br>- How to use caustics to generate GI
	<br><br>I realise that any of this requires time. I <i>may</i> try generating some of this myself, but I thought that perhaps some of you might have ideas for some of these, based on the questions you've asked/answered on the forums, and/or content you have lying around from test scenes, and/or tutorials, etc.
	<br><br>Feel free to post anything regarding Help content to Nik777 on any of the forums.
