Art of Illusion v2.8.1Copyright 1999-2010 by Peter Eastman1. InstructionsThe Java classes which make up Art of Illusion are packaged into several.jar files: ArtOfIllusion.jar, which contains the main program, and various plugin files, which must be placed in the Plugins directory.  The sourcefiles are organized in the same way.  There is one directory corresponding toeach .jar file, containing the source code for the classes which go into thatfile.You will also find an XML file corresponding to each .jar file.  Theseare build scripts for use with the Ant build tool (available fromhttp://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  To build each file, simply invoke Ant on thecorresponding script.  For example,ant -buildfile ArtOfIllusion.xmlYou must build ArtOfIllusion.jar before building any of the plugins, sincetheir build scripts need to reference it when compiling.  The plugins canbe built in any order.  The scripts will automatically put the finished .jarfiles into the correct locations.  You must have the Java Media Framework(JMF) installed in order to build Art of Illusion.A file called classes.jar is included with the source code.  This containsvarious classes written by other people which are used by Art of Illusion.All of these classes are either public domain, or are distributed under licenses less restrictive than the GPL, and hence may be freely distributed.Specifically:- Jama.Matrix, Jama.SingularValueDecomposition, and Jama.util.Maths arefrom the public domain Java Matrix (JAMA) package. The complete JAMApackage, including source code, can be found athttp://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/.- DCT, Huffman, JpegEncoder, and JpegInfo are copyright 1998 by James R. Weeksand BioElectroMech.  The complete license information for them is given below.  The source code can be found at http://www.obrador.com/essentialjpeg/jpeg.htm.There is also a file called beanshell.jar, which contains the classes for theBeanshell scripting language.  Beanshell is distributed under the Lesser GnuPublic License (LGPL), which explicitly permits redistribution under the GPL.The source code is available from http://www.beanshell.org.Finally, there is a file called Buoy.jar, which contains the Buoy userinterface library.  Buoy is in the public domain.  The source code can befound at http://buoy.sourceforge.net.In addition, there is a file called jogl.jar which contains the classes forJogl, an OpenGL binding for Java.  These classes are not actually added toArtOfIllusion.jar, and this file is included only for use during compilation.To actually use OpenGL, this jar file must be included in the classpath whenthe program is run, and the appropriate platform-specific Jogl native librarymust be included in the library search path.  Jogl can be found athttps://jogl.dev.java.net.Further information about Art of Illusion can be found at:http://www.artofillusion.org2.
