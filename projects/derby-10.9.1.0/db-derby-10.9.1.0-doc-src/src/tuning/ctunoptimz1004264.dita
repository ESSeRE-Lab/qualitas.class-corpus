<conbody>
<p>Some predicates are transformed internally into ones that provide starting
and stopping points and are therefore optimizable.</p>
<p>Predicates that use the following comparison operators can be transformed
internally into optimizable predicates:  
<ul>
<li>BETWEEN</li>
<li>LIKE (in certain situations)</li>
<li>IN (in certain situations)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For details on these and other transformations, see <xref href="ctuntransform13966.dita#ctuntransform13966"/>.</p>
