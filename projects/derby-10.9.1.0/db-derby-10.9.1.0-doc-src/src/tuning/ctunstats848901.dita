<title>How the optimizer determines the number of rows in a table</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The optimizer uses a stored row count to determine the number of rows in
a table, which is maintained automatically by the system. </p>
<p>Normally, an updated value is stored in the database whenever the database
goes through an orderly shutdown (as long as the database is not read-only).
Stored row counts become inaccurate if there is a non-orderly shutdown (for
example, a power failure or other type of system crash).</p>
<p>You can correct the optimizer's row count without shutting down the
system; <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> sets the stored row count for a table to the correct value
whenever a query that does a full scan on the base conglomerate finishes.
For example, executing the following query sets the row count for table <i>Flights</i> to the correct value:  
<codeblock><b>
SELECT * FROM Flights</b></codeblock></p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> also sets the stored row count on a table to the correct value
whenever a user creates a new index or primary key, unique, or foreign key
constraint on the table. This value is not guaranteed to be written to disk.</p>
