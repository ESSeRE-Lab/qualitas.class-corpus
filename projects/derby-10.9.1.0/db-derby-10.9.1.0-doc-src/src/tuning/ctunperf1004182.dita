<title>When large page size is not desirable</title>

<conbody>
<ul>
<li><i>Limited memory</i>  
<p>Large database pages reduce
I/O time because <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can access more data with fewer I/Os. However,
large pages require more memory. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> allocates a bulk number of database
pages in its page cache by default. If the page size is large, the system
might run out of memory.</p>
<p>Here's a rough guideline: If the system
is running Windows 95 and has more than 32 MB (or Windows NT and has more
than 64 MB), it is probably beneficial to use 8K rather than 4K as the default
page size.</p>
<p>Use the <i>-mx</i> flag as an optional parameter
to the JVM to give the JVM more memory upon startup.</p>
<p>For example:  
<codeblock><b>java -mx64 myApp</b></codeblock></p></li>
<li><i>Limited disk space</i>  
<p>If you cannot afford the
overhead of the minimum two pages per table, keep your page sizes small.</p></li>
</ul>
