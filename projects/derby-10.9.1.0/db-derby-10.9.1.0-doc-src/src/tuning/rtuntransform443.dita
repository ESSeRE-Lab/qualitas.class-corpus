<title>Character string without wildcards</title>
<prolog>

<section><p>A LIKE predicate is transformed into a predicate that uses the = operator
(and a NOT LIKE predicate is transformed into one that uses &lt;&gt;) when
the character string does not contain any wildcards. For example:   
<codeblock><b>country LIKE 'Chile'</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>becomes  
<codeblock><b>country = 'Chile'</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>and  
<codeblock><b>country NOT LIKE 'Chile'</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>becomes  
<codeblock><b>country &lt;&gt; 'Chile'</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>Predicates that use the = operator are <xref href="ctuntransform13966.dita#ctuntransform13966/rtuntransform19435">optimizable</xref>. Predicates that use the &lt;&gt; operator are <xref href="ctuntransform13966.dita#ctuntransform13966/rtuntransform26698">sargable</xref>.</p></section>
