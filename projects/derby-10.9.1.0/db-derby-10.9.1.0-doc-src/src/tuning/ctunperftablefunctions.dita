<conbody>
<p>The optimizer makes hard-coded guesses about how to calculate the cost of a
user-written Derby-style table function. For this reason, the
optimizer may place a table function in an inefficient position in the
join order. You can give the optimizer more information so that it
makes better choices. See "Programming Derby-style table functions" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for details.</p>
<p>Using restricted table functions can also improve performance greatly. See
"Writing restricted table functions" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
