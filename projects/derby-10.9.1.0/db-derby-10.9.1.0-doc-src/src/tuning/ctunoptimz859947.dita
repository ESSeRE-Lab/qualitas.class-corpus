<title>DISTINCT</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Tuple filtering is applied for a DISTINCT when the following criteria are
met:   
<ul>
<li>The SELECT list is composed entirely of simple column references and constants. </li>
<li>All simple column references come from the same table and the optimizer
has chosen the table in question to be the outermost table in the query block. </li>
<li>The optimizer has chosen an index as the access path for the table in
question. </li>
<li>The simple column references in the SELECT list, plus any simple column
references from the table that have equality predicates on them, are a prefix
of the index that the optimizer selected as the access path for the table. </li>
</ul> 
<note>The set of column references must be an in-order prefix
of the index.</note></p>
<p>Here is the most common case in which tuple filtering will be applied:
  
<codeblock><b>SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t1</b></codeblock></p>
<p>Equality predicates allow tuple filtering on the following:   
<codeblock><b>SELECT DISTINCT c2
FROM t1
WHERE c1 = 5

SELECT DISTINCT c2, c4
FROM t1
WHERE c1 = 5 and c3 = 7
<ph>-- the columns don't have to be in the
-- same order as the index</ph>
SELECT DISTINCT c2, c1
FROM t1</b></codeblock></p>
</conbody></concept>
