<conbody>
<p>If you use
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s in-memory database
facility, it is important to configure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The size of the Java heap.</i> The memory requirements for an in-memory
database should be similar to the memory requirements for using the file system,
plus the size of the user data.</li>
<li><i>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> page cache
size.</i> For good performance, use no less than the default size of 1000 pages.
The data must pass through the page cache, even though the user data is already
stored in main memory. A larger page cache may improve performance at the
expense of increased memory usage. See
<xref href="ctunperf54492.dita#ctunperf54492"></xref> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to prevent
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> from writing anything
to the <i>derby.log</i> file, use one of the <i>derby.stream.error</i>
properties (for instance, <i>derby.stream.error.field</i>).</p>
<p>For more information, see "Using in-memory databases" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
