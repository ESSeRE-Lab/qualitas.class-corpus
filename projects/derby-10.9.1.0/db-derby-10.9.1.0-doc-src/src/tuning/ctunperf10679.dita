<conbody>
<p>By creating indexes on columns by which you often search a table, you can
reduce the number of rows that <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> has to scan, thus improving performance.
Depending on the size of the table and the number of rows returned, the improvement
can be dramatic. Indexes work best when the number of rows returned from the
query is a fraction of the number of rows in the table.</p>
<p>There are some trade-offs in using indexes: indexes speed up searches but
slow down inserts and updates. As a general rule, every table should have
at least a primary key constraint.</p>
