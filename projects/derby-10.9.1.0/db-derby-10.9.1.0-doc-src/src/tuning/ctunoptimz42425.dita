<conbody>
<p>The query optimizer makes cost-based decisions to determine:  
<ul>
<li>Which index (if any) to use on each table in a query (see <xref href="ctunoptimz32184.dita#ctunoptimz32184"/>)</li>
<li>The join order (see <xref href="ctunoptimz20327.dita#ctunoptimz20327"/>)</li>
<li>The join strategy (see <xref href="ctunoptimz11941.dita#ctunoptimz11941"/>)</li>
<li>Whether to avoid additional sorting (see <xref href="ctunoptimz27036.dita#ctunoptimz27036"/>)</li>
<li>Automatic lock escalation (see <xref href="ctunoptimz19357.dita#ctunoptimz19357"/>)</li>
<li>Whether to use bulk fetch (see <xref href="ctunoptimz29384.dita#ctunoptimz29384"/>)</li>
</ul></p>
