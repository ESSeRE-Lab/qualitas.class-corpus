<section><p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> transforms COUNT(nonNullableColumn) into COUNT(*). This improves
performance by potentially reducing the number of referenced columns in the
table (each referenced column needs to be read in for each row) and by giving
the optimizer more access path choices. For example, the cheapest access path
for  
<codeblock><b>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1</b></codeblock>is
the index on <i>t1</i> with the smallest number of leaf pages,
and the optimizer is free to choose that path.</p></section>
