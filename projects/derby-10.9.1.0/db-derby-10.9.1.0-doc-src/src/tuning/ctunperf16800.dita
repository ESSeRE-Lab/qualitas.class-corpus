<title>Avoid inserts in autocommit mode if possible</title>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>autocommit mode</indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Inserts can be painfully slow in autocommit mode because each commit involves
an update of the log on the disk for each INSERT statement. The commit will
not return until a physical disk write is executed. To speed things up: <ul>
<li>Run in autocommit false mode, execute a number of inserts in one transaction,
and then explicitly issue a commit.</li>
<li>If your application allows an initial load into the table, you can use
the import procedures to insert data into a table. 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will
not log the individual inserts when loading into an empty table using these
interfaces. See the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> and the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph> for
more information on the import procedures.</li>
</ul></p>
