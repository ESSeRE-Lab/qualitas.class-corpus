<title>Combining ORDER BY and DISTINCT</title>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords>
<indexterm>DISTINCT<indexterm>combined with ORDER BY</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>

</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Without a transformation, a statement that contains both DISTINCT and ORDER
BY would require two separate sorting steps-one to satisfy DISTINCT
and one to satisfy ORDER BY. (Currently, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> uses sorting to evaluate
DISTINCT. There are, in theory, other ways to accomplish this.) In some situations, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can
transform the statement internally into one that contains only one of these
keywords. The requirements are:  
<ul>
<li>The columns in the ORDER BY list must be a subset of the columns in the
SELECT list.</li>
<li>All the columns in the ORDER BY list are sorted in ascending order.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>A unique index is not required.</p>
<p>For example:  
<codeblock><b>SELECT DISTINCT miles, meal
FROM Flights
ORDER BY meal</b></codeblock></p>
<p>is transformed into  
<codeblock><b>SELECT DISTINCT miles, meal
FROM Flights</b></codeblock>Note that these are not equivalent functions; this
is simply an internal <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> transformation.</p>
</conbody></concept>
