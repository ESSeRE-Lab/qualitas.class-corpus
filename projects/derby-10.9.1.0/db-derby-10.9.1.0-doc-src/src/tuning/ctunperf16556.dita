<conbody>
<p>By default, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does not boot databases (and some core <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> classes)
in the system at <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> startup but only at connection time. For multi-user
systems, you might want to reduce connection time by booting one or all databases
at startup instead.</p>
<p>For embedded systems, you might want to boot the database in a separate
thread (either as part of the startup, or in a connection request).</p>
<p>For more information, see <xref href="ctundepth14326.dita#ctundepth14326"/>.</p>
