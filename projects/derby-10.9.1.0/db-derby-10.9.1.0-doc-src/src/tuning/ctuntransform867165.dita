<title>DISTINCT elimination in IN, ANY, and EXISTS subqueries</title>

<conbody>
<p>An IN, ANY, or EXISTS subquery evaluates to true if there is at least one
row that causes the subquery to evaluate to true. These semantics make a DISTINCT
within an IN, ANY, or EXISTS subquery unnecessary. The following two queries
are equivalent and the first is transformed into the second:   
<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT c2 FROM t2 WHERE t1.c3 = t2.c4)

SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 IN
    (SELECT c2 FROM t2 WHERE t1.c3 = t2.c4)</b></codeblock></p>
</conbody></concept>
