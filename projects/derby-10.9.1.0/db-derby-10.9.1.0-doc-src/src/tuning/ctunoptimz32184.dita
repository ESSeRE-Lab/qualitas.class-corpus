<conbody>
<p>The optimizer's choice of access path can depend on the number of rows
it will have to read. It tries to choose a path that requires the fewest number
of rows read. For joins, the number of rows read also depends heavily on the
join order (discussed in <xref href="ctunoptimz20327.dita#ctunoptimz20327"/>.)</p>
<p>How does the optimizer know how many rows a particular access path will
read? The answer: sometimes it knows exactly, and sometimes it has to make
an educated guess. See <xref href="ctunstats18908.dita#ctunstats18908"/>.</p>
