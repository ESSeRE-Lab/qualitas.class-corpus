<conbody>
<p>You can increase the size of a database's data page cache, which consists
of the data pages kept in memory. When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can access a database page
from the cache instead of reading it from disk, it can return data much more
quickly.</p>
<p>The default size of the data page cache is 1000 pages. In a multi-user
environment, or in an environment where the user accesses a lot of data, increase
the size of the cache. You configure its size with the <i>derby.storage.pageCacheSize</i> property. For more information about
how to set this property and how to estimate memory use, see the
"<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties" section of
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p> 
<note><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can
run even with a small amount of memory and even with a small data page cache,
although it might perform poorly. Increasing the amount of memory available
to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and increasing the size of the data page cache improve performance.</note>
<p>In addition, you might want to prime <i>all</i> the caches
in the background to make queries run faster when the user gets around to
running them.</p>
<p>These caches include:  
<ul>
<li>The page (user data) cache (described above)  
<p>Prime this cache by selecting
from much-used tables that are expected to fit into the data page cache.</p></li>
<li>The data dictionary cache  
<p>The cache that holds information stored
in the system tables. You can prime this cache with a query that selects from
commonly used user tables.</p></li>
<li>The statement cache  
<p>The cache that holds database-specific <i>Statements</i> (including <i>PreparedStatements</i>). You
can prime this cache by preparing common queries ahead of time in a separate
thread.</p></li>
</ul></p>
