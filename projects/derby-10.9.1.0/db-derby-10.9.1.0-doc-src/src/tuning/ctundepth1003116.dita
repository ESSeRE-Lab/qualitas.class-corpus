<title>Make sure indexes are being used, and rebuild them</title>

<conbody>
<p>If an index is useful for a query, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is probably using it. However,
you need to make sure. Analyze the way <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is executing your application's
queries. See <xref href="ttundepth33391.dita#ttundepth33391"/> for information on
how to do this.</p>
<p>In addition, over time, index pages fragment. Rebuilding indexes improves
performance significantly in these situations. To rebuild an index, drop it
and then re-create it.</p>
