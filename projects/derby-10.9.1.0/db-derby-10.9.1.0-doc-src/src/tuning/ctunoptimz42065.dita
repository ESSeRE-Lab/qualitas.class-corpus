<title>Transaction-based lock escalation</title>

<conbody>
<p>The optimizer makes its decisions for the scope of a single statement at
compile time; the runtime overrides are also for the scope of a single statement.
As you know, a transaction can span several statements. For connections running
in TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE isolation and for connections that are doing a
lot of inserts or updates, a transaction can accumulate a number of row locks
even though no single statement would touch enough rows to make the optimizer
choose table-level locking for any single table.</p>
<p>However, during a transaction, the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system tracks the number
of locks for all tables in the transaction, and when this number exceeds a
threshold number (which you can configure; see <xref href="ctunoptimz26019.dita#ctunoptimz26019"/>), the system attempts to escalate locking for at least one
of the tables involved from row-level to table-level locking.</p>
<p>The system attempts to escalate to table-level locking for each table that
has a burdensome number of locks by trying to obtain the relevant table lock.
If the system can lock the table without waiting, the system locks the entire
table and releases all row locks for the table. If the system cannot lock
the table without waiting, the system leaves the row locks intact.</p>
<p>After a table is locked in either mode, a transaction does not acquire
any subsequent row-level locks on a table. For example, if you have a table
called <i>Hotels</i> that contained several thousand rows
and a transaction locks the entire table in share mode in order to read data,
it might later need to lock a particular row in exclusive mode in order to
update the row. However, the previous table-level lock on <i>Hotels</i> forces the exclusive lock to be table-level as well.</p>
<p>This transaction-based runtime decision is independent of any compilation
decision. </p>
<p>If when the escalation threshold was exceeded the system did not obtain
any table locks because it would have had to wait, the next lock escalation
attempt is delayed until the number of held locks has increased by some significant
amount, for example from 5000 to 6000.</p>
<p>Here are some examples, assuming the escalation threshold is 5000.</p> 
<p>In the following table, a single database table holds the majority of the
locks.</p>
