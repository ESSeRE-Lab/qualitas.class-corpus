<title>Optimizer estimates</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>RUNTIMESTATISTICS show the optimizer estimates for a particular node. They
show the optimizer's estimated row count and the optimizer's "estimated
cost."</p>
<p>The <i>estimated row count</i> is the query optimizer's
estimate of the number of qualifying rows for the table or index for the entire
life of the query. If the table is the inner table of a join, the estimated
row count will be for all the scans of the table, not just for a single scan
of the table.  </p>
<p>The <i>estimated cost</i> consists of a number, which
is a relative number; it does not correspond directly to any time estimate.
It is not, for example, the number of milliseconds or rows. Instead, the optimizer
constructs this number for each possible access path. It compares the numbers
and chooses the access path with the smallest number.</p>
