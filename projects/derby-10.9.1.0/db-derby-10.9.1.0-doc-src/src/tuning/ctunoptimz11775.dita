<conbody>
<p>In addition, you can explicitly lock a table for the duration of a transaction
with the LOCK TABLE statement. This is useful if you know in advance that
an entire table should be locked and want to save the resources required for
obtaining row locks until the system escalates the locking. For information
about this feature, see "LOCK TABLE statement" in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
