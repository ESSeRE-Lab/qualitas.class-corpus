<title>When large page size does not improve performance</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<ul>
<li><i>Selective Queries</i>  
<p>If your application's
queries are very selective and use an index, large page size does not provide
much benefit and potentially degrades performance because a larger page takes
longer to read.</p></li>
