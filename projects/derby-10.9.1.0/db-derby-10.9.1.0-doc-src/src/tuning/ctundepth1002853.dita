<title>Create useful indexes</title>
<shortdesc>Indexes are useful when a query contains a WHERE clause.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>indexes<indexterm>guidance, creating</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Without a WHERE clause, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is <i>supposed</i> to
return all the data in the table, and so a table scan is the correct (if not
desirable) behavior. (More about that in <xref href="ctundepth36205.dita#ctundepth36205"></xref>.)</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> creates indexes
on tables in the following situations:   <ul>
<li>When you define a primary key, unique, or foreign key constraint on a
table. See "CONSTRAINT clause" in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite> for
more information.</li>
<li>When you explicitly create an index on a table with a CREATE INDEX statement. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>For an index to be useful for a particular statement, one of the columns
in the statement's WHERE clause must be the first column in the index's key.
  <note>For a complete discussion of how indexes work and when they are useful,
see <xref href="ctunoptimz33368.dita#ctunoptimz33368"></xref> and <xref href="ctunoptimz30217.dita#ctunoptimz30217"></xref>.</note></p>
<p>Indexes provide some other benefits as well:   <ul>
<li>If all the data requested are in the index, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does
not have to go to the table at all. (See <xref href="ctunoptimz30768.dita#ctunoptimz30768"></xref>.)</li>
<li>For operations that require a sort (ORDER BY), if <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> uses
the index to retrieve the data, it does not have to perform a separate sorting
step for some of these operations in some situations. (See <xref href="ctunoptimz27036.dita#ctunoptimz27036"></xref>.)</li>
</ul> <note><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does
not support indexing on columns with data types like BLOB, CLOB, and XML.</note></p>
