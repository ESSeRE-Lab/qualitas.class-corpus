<conbody>
<p>Stick with 4K as the page size (the default, and the size operating systems
use) unless:  
<ul>
<li>You are storing large objects.</li>
<li>You have very large tables (over 10,000 rows).  
<p>For very large tables,
large pages reduces the number of I/Os required.</p></li>
<li>For read-only applications, use a large page size (for example, 32K) with
a <i>pageReservedSpace</i> of 0.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>You might need to experiment with page size to find out what works best
for your application and database.</p>
