<p>The optimizer determines the number of rows that will be scanned from disk
when deciding on an access path for a particular table (whether to use an
index or to scan the table).
<ul>
<li>The optimizer knows "exactly" the number of rows that will be
scanned from disk for table scans (see <xref href="ctunstats57793.dita#ctunstats57793"/>).</li>
<li>For index scans, the optimizer must estimate the number of rows that will
be scanned from disk. (see <xref href="ctunstats60669.dita#ctunstats60669"/>). <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> might
be able to use cardinality statistics to make a better estimate of the number
of rows that will be scanned from disk as described in this chapter.</li>
</ul></p>
