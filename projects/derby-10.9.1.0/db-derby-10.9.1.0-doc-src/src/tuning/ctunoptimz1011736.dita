<title>Quick DISTINCT scans</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can use a hash table instead of a sorter to eliminate duplicates
when performing a DISTINCT in the following cases:  
<ul>
<li>There is a single table in the query block. </li>
<li>An ORDER BY clause is not merged into the DISTINCT. </li>
<li>All entries in the SELECT list are simple column references. </li>
<li>There are no predicates in the query block. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>This technique allows for minimal locking when performing the scan at the
READ COMMITTED isolation level.   
<note>This technique appears in
RunTimeStatistics as a <i>DistinctScanResultSe</i>t.</note></p>
