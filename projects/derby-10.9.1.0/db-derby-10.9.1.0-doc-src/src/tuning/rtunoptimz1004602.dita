<section><p>The following queries do <i>not</i> provide start and
stop conditions for a scan of <i>OrigIndex</i>, the index
on the <i>orig_airport</i> column in <i>Flights.</i> However, some of these queries allow <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to do an index
rather than a table scan because the index covers the query.  
<codeblock><b><ph>-- <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>  would scan entire table; comparison is not with a 
-- constant or with a column in another table</ph>
SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE orig_airport = dest_airport
<ph>-- <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>  would scan entire table; &lt;&gt; operator is not optimizable</ph>
SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE orig_airport &lt;&gt; 'SFO'
<ph>-- not valid operator for matching index scan
-- However, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>  would do an index 
-- rather than a table scan because
-- index covers query</ph>
SELECT orig_airport
FROM Flights
WHERE orig_airport &lt;&gt; 'SFO'
<ph>-- use of a function is not simple column reference

-- (index covers query)</ph>
