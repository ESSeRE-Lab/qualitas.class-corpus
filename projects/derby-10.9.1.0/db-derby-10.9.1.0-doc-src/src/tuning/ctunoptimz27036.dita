<title>About the optimizer's choice of sort avoidance</title>

<indexterm>Sort avoidance</indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Some SQL statements require that data be ordered, including those with
ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and DISTINCT. MIN() and MAX() aggregates also require
ordering of data.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can sometimes avoid sorting steps for:  
<ul>
<li>statements with ORDER BY  
<p>See <xref href="ctunoptimz56859.dita#ctunoptimz56859"/></p></li>
</ul></p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can also perform the following optimizations, but they are
not based on cost:  
<ul>
<li>sort avoidance for DISTINCT and GROUP BYs  
<p>See <xref href="ctunoptimz22460.dita#ctunoptimz22460"/></p></li>
<li>statements with a MIN() aggregate  
<p>See <xref href="ctunoptimz22111.dita#ctunoptimz22111"/></p></li>
</ul></p>
