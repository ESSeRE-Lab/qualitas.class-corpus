<section><p>A BETWEEN predicate is transformed into equivalent predicates that use
the &gt;= and &lt;= operators, which are optimizable. For example:  
<codeblock><b>flight_date BETWEEN DATE('2005-04-01') and DATE('2005-04-10')</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>is transformed into  
<codeblock><b>flight_date &gt;= DATE('2005-04-01')
AND flight_date &gt;= '2005-04-10'</b></codeblock></p></section>
