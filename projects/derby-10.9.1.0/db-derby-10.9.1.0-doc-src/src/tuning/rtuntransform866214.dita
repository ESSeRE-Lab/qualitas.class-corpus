<title>NOT IN predicate transformations</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<refbody>
<section><p>NOT IN lists are transformed into multiple predicates that use
the &lt;&gt; operator. &lt;&gt; predicates are not optimizable, but they are sargable
(See <xref href="ctuntransform13966.dita#ctuntransform13966"></xref>).
For example:   <codeblock><b>orig_airport NOT IN ('ABQ', 'AKL', 'DSM')</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>becomes   <codeblock><b>orig_airport &lt;&gt; 'ABQ'
AND orig_airport &lt;&gt; 'AKL'
AND orig_airport &lt;&gt; 'DSM'</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>In addition, large lists are sorted in ascending order for performance
reasons.</p></section>
