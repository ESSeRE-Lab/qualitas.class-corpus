<conbody>
<p>The system property <i>derby.locks.escalationThreshold</i> determines
the threshold for number of rows touched for a particular table above which
the system will escalate to table-level locking. The default value of this
property is 5000. For large systems, set this property to a higher value.
For smaller systems, lower it. See the
"<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties" section of
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for details on this property.</p>
<p>This property also sets the threshold for transaction-based lock escalation
(see <xref href="ctunoptimz42065.dita#ctunoptimz42065"/>).  
<note>For more
information about lock escalation, see <xref href="ctunoptimz27975.dita#ctunoptimz27975"/>.</note></p>
