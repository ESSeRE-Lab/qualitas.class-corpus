<section><p>The following queries do provide start and stop conditions for a scan of
the primary key index on the <i>flight_id</i> and <i>segment_number</i> columns in <i>Flights</i>:  
<codeblock><b><ph>-- the where clause compares both columns with valid
-- operators to constants</ph>
SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE flight_id = 'AA1115'
AND segment_number &lt; 2
<ph>-- the first column is in a valid comparison</ph>
SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE flight_id &lt; 'BB'
<ph>-- LIKE is transformed into &gt;= and &lt;=, providing
-- start and stop conditions</ph>
SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE flight_id LIKE 'AA%'</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>The following queries do not:  
<codeblock><b><ph>-- segment_number is in the index, but it's not the first column;
-- there's no logical starting and stopping place</ph>
SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE segment_number = 2
<ph>-- <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>  would scan entire table; comparison of first column
-- is not with a constant or column in another table
-- and no covering index applies</ph>
