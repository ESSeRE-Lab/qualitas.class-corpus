<conbody>
<p>As you learned in the previous section, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> might be able to use
an index on a column to find data more quickly. If <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can use an
index for a statement, that statement is said to be <i>optimizable</i>. The statements shown in the preceding section allow <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
use the index because their WHERE clauses provide start and stop conditions.
That is, they tell <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> the point at which to begin its scan of the
index and where to end the scan.</p>
<p>For example, a statement with a WHERE clause looking for rows for which
the <i>orig_airport</i> value is less than <i>BBB</i> means that <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> must begin the scan at the beginning of the
index; it can end the scan at <i>BBB</i>. This means that
it avoids scanning the index for most of the entries.</p>
<p>An index scan that uses start or stop conditions is called a <i>matching index scan</i>.  
<note>A WHERE clause can have more than
one part. Parts are linked with the word <i>AND</i> or <i>OR</i>. Each part is called a <i>predicate</i>. WHERE clauses with predicates joined by OR are not optimizable. WHERE
clauses with predicates joined by AND are optimizable if <i>at least one</i> of the predicates is optimizable. For example:  
<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM Flights
WHERE flight_id = 'AA1111' AND
segment_number &lt;&gt; 2</b></codeblock></note></p>
<p>In this example, the first predicate is optimizable; the second predicate
is not. Therefore, the statement is optimizable.  
<note>In a few
cases, a WHERE clause with predicates joined by OR can be transformed into
an optimizable statement. See <xref href="rtuntransform590.dita#rtuntransform590"/>.</note></p>
