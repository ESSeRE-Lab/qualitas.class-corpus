<conbody>
<p>Cardinality statistics are computed by the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system and stored
in the system tables. For information on when these statistics get created
or updated, see <xref href="ctunstats57373.dita#ctunstats57373"/>.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can use cardinality statistics if:  
<ul>
<li>The statistics exist</li>
<li>The relevant columns in the WHERE column are leading columns in an index</li>
<li>The columns are compared to values using only the = operator</li>
<li>Statistics are not turned off in the system or query</li>
</ul></p>
