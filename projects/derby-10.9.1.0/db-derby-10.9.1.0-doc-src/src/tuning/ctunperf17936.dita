<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> features crash recovery that restores the state of committed
transactions in the event that the database exits unexpectedly, for example
during a power failure. The recovery processing happens the next time the
database is started after the unexpected exit. Your application can reduce
the amount of work that the database has to do to start up the next time by
shutting it down in an orderly fashion. See "Shutting Down <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> or an
Individual Database" in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite>. </p>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> utilities all perform an "orderly" shutdown.</p>
