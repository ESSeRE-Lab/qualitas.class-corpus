    <p>As described in <xref href="ctunstats849251.dita#ctunstats849251">
        What are cardinality statistics?</xref>,
    the cardinality statistics for a table influence the optimizer's
    choice of a query plan
for a query which accesses the table's data.
If the cardinality statistics are missing or out of date, the optimizer may
choose an inferior query plan, resulting in poor performance.
</p>
<p>
One common situation which can causing missing or out of date statistics is
when indexes are created before the data is added to the tables.
Cardinality statistics are automatically updated in certain situations, such as
when an index is added to an existing non-empty table.
<xref href="ctunstats57373.dita#ctunstats57373">When cardinality
    statistics are automatically updated</xref> describes the automatic
statistics updates in more detail.
However, adding, updating, and deleting data after the index
has been created can cause the cardinality statistics to become stale; see
<xref href="ctunstats849505.dita#ctunstats849505">
    when cardinality statistics go stale</xref> for more information about
what can cause missing or out of date statistics..
</p>
<p>
To ensure that the statistics are available and accurate, you can run either
of the following built-in system procedures:
<ul>
<li><codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph></li>
<li><codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_UPDATE_STATISTICS</codeph></li>
</ul>
Note that the <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph>
system procedure does <b>not</b> update statistics as part of its
processing.
</p>
<p>
You can find additional information about these system procedures, including
the syntax for invoking them, in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.
