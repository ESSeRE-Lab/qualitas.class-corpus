<title>Optimizer overrides</title>
<conbody>
<p>RUNTIMESTATISTICS provides information about user-specified optimizer hints
that were specified by using a  -- DERBY-PROPERTIES clause.</p>
<p>The following example shows a SELECT statement in which the optimizer was
forced to use a particular index:<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM t1 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index = t1_c1 
FOR UPDATE OF c2, c1</b></codeblock></p>
<p>RUNTIMESTATISTICS returns the following information about this statement:<codeblock>Statement Name: 
		 null
Statement Text: select * from t1 --DERBY-PROPERTIES index = t1_c1 
for update of c2, c1
