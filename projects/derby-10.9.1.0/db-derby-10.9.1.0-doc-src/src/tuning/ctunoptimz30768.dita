<conbody>
<p>Even when there is no definite starting or stopping point for an index
scan, an index can speed up the execution of a query if the index covers the
query. An index <i>covers the query</i> if all the columns
specified in the query are part of the index. These are the columns that are
all columns referenced in the query, not just columns in a WHERE clause. If
so, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> never has to go to the data pages at all, but can retrieve
all data through index access alone. For example, in the following queries, <i>OrigIndex</i> covers the query:  
<codeblock><b>SELECT orig_airport
FROM Flights

SELECT DISTINCT lower(orig_airport) FROM Flights 
FROM Flights</b></codeblock></p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can get all required data out of the index instead of from
the table.</p>
<note>If the query produces an updatable result set, 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will retrieve all 
data from the data pages even if there is an index that covers the query.</note>
</conbody></concept>
