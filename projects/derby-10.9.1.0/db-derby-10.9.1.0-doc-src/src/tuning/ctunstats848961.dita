<conbody>
<p>When the exact start and stop conditions are known at compilation time,
the optimizer uses the index itself to make a very precise estimate of the
number of rows that will be scanned from disk. An example of a query with
a known search condition:</p>
<codeblock><b>SELECT *
FROM Flights
WHERE orig_airport = 'SFO'</b></codeblock>
<p>The search value, 'SFO', is known. The optimizer will be able to make an
accurate estimate of the cost of using the index <i>orig_index</i>. </p>
<p>In addition, if the index is unique, and the WHERE clause involves an =
or IS NULL comparison to all the columns in the index, the optimizer knows
that only a single row will be scanned from disk. For example:  
<codeblock><b><b>-- there's a unique key on city_id</b>
SELECT * FROM Cities WHERE city_id = 1</b></codeblock></p>
</conbody></concept>
