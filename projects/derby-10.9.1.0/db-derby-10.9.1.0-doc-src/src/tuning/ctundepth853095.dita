<conbody>
<p>If you are using statistics timing, RUNTIMESTATISTICS provides information
about how long each stage of the statement took. An SQL statement has
two basic stages within <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>: compilation and execution. Compilation
is the work done while the statement is prepared. Compilation is composed
of the following stages: parsing, binding, optimization, and code generation.
Execution is the actual evaluation of the statement.</p>
