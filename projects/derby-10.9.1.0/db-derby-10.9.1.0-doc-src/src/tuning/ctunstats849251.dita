<title>What are cardinality statistics?</title>

<conbody>
<p>When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> creates statistics for a table's index, it calculates
and stores in the system tables:  
<ul>
<li>The number of rows in the table</li>
<li>The number of unique values for a set of columns for leading columns in
an index key, also known as <i>cardinality</i>. Leading columns
refers to the first column, or the first and second column, or the first,
second, and third column of an index (and so on). <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> cannot compute
the number of columns for which a combination of the non-leading columns is
unique. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>For example, consider the primary key on the table FlightAvailability:
 
<codeblock><b>CONSTRAINT FLIGHTAVAILABILITY_PK Primary Key (
      FLIGHT_ID,
      SEGMENT_NUMBER,
      FLIGHT_DATE)</b></codeblock></p>
<p>For this index, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> keeps the following information:  
<ul>
<li>The number of rows in the table <i>FlightAvailability</i></li>
<li>The number of unique rows for the full key (<i>flight_id</i>, <i>segment_number</i>, <i>flight_date</i>)</li>
<li>The number of unique rows for the key (<i>flight_id</i>, <i>segment_number</i>)</li>
<li>The number of unique rows for the key (<i>flight_id</i>)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>How does <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> use these two numbers-the number of rows in
a table and the cardinality of a particular key-to determine the selectivity
of a query? Take this example:  
<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM Flights, FlightAvailability
WHERE Flights.flight_id = OtherTable.flight_id</b></codeblock></p>
<p>If the cardinality for flight_id in <i>Flights</i> is
250, then the selectivity of the predicate is 1/250. The optimizer would estimate
the number of rows read to be:  
<codeblock><b>((Rows in Flights) * (Rows in OtherTable))/250</b></codeblock></p>
