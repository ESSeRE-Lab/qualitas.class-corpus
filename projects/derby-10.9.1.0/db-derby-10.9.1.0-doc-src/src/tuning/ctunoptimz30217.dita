<title>Index use and access paths</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>If you define an index on a column or columns, the query optimizer can
use the index to find data in the column more quickly. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> automatically
creates indexes to back up primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints,
so those indexes are always available to the optimizer, as well as those that
you explicitly create with the CREATE INDEX command. The way <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> gets
to the data-via an index or directly via the table-is called the <i>access path</i>.</p>
