<conbody>
<p>Row-level locking improves concurrency in a multi-user system. However,
a large number of row locks can degrade performance. <xref href="ctunoptimz19357.dita#ctunoptimz19357"/> discussed the way the optimizer makes some compile-time decisions
about escalating row locks to table locks for performance reasons. This section
discusses ways in which the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system and the user can make similar
lock escalations.
