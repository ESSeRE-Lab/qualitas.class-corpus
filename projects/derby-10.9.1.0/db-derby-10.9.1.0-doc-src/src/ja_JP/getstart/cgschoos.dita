<title>Choosing an installer</title>
<conbody>
<p>You can choose between three <ph conref="gsconrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> installation
packages. </p>
<p><b>Windows:</b> The Windows installer provides an IBM JRE for Windows that
you can use to run <ph conref="gsconrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.
This is a quick, native installer for a user that does not have any previous
knowledge or experience with Java. The Windows installer has a footprint of
approximately 60M.</p>
<p><b>Linux:</b> The Linux installer provides an IBM JRE for Linux that you
can use to run <ph conref="gsconrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. This
is a quick, native installer for a user that does not have any previous knowledge
or experience with Java. The Linux installer has a footprint of approximately
70M.</p>
<p><b>Java:</b> The Java installer does not include a JRE and has a smaller
footprint of approximately 15M. It provides a consistent method of installation
across multiple platforms. You can run the Java installer on any operating
system, including Windows and Linux. The Java installer requires that you
already have JVM version 1.3 or later installed on your system. </p>
<p>If you are using the Java installer and do not already have a JVM installed,
you should contact a JVM vendor for your operating system.</p>
<p> <note>A JRE (Java runtime environment) is a subset of the components included
in a Java Developer Kit. A JRE contains a JVM and provides the ability to
run Java applications. However, JREs do not include the tools and utilities
necessary to develop applications. If you are planning to develop applications,
you should install a Java Developer Kit.</note></p>
