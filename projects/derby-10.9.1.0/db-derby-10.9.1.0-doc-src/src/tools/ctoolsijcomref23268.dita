<title>ij commands</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p><codeph>ij</codeph> accepts several commands to control its use of JDBC. It recognizes
a semicolon as the end of an <codeph>ij</codeph> or SQL command; it treats semicolons
within SQL comments, strings, and delimited identifiers as part of those constructs,
not as the end of the command. Semicolons are required at the end of an <codeph>ij</codeph> or SQL statement.</p>
<p>All <codeph>ij</codeph> commands, identifiers, and keywords are case-insensitive.</p>
<p>Commands can span multiple lines without any special escaping for the ends
of lines. This means that if a string spans a line, the new lines will show
up in the value in the string.</p>
<p><codeph>ij</codeph> treats any command that it does not recognize as an SQL command
to be passed to the underlying connection, so syntactic errors in <codeph>ij</codeph> commands will cause them to be handed to the SQL engine and will probably
result in SQL parsing errors.</p>
