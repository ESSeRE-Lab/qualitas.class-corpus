<section><title>Function</title><p>Specifies the logon name used to establish
the connection. This property is used in conjunction with the <i>ij.password</i> property
to authenticate a connection. If authentication is not active then these properties
are ignored.</p><p>When a username is supplied you need to be aware of the
database schema. When you connect using <codeph>ij.user</codeph>, the default
database schema applied to all SQL statements is the same as the user id provided
even if the schema does not exist. Use the SET SCHEMA statement to change
the default when the schema does not match the username. Alternately you can
fully qualify the database objects referred to in the SQL statements . If
no user is specified, no SET SCHEMA statement has been issued, or SQL statements
do not include the schema name, all database objects are assumed to be under
the APP schema.</p> </section>
