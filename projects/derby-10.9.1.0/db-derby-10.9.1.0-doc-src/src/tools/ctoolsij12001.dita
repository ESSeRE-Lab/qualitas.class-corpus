<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>ij is a JDBC-neutral scripting tool with a small command set. It can be
used to access any JDBC driver and database accessible through that driver. </p>
<p>The main benefit of a tool such as ij is that it is easy to run scripts
for creating a database schema and automating other repetitive database tasks.</p>
<p>In addition, ij accepts and processes SQL commands interactively for ad
hoc database access.</p>
