<section><title>Description</title>
<p>Displays the results of a previously started asynchronous command.</p>
<p>The identifier for the asynchronous command must have been used in a previous <xref href="rtoolsijcomref37862.dita#rtoolsijcomref37862">Async</xref> command on this connection. The Wait For command waits for the SQL statement
to complete execution, if it has not already, and then displays the results.
If the statement returns a result set, the Wait For command steps through the rows, not the <xref href="rtoolsijcomref37862.dita#rtoolsijcomref37862">Async</xref> command. This might result in further execution time passing
during the result display. </p>
