<title>Database connection URLs</title>

<conbody>
<p>A JDBC URL provides a way of identifying a database so that the appropriate
driver recognizes it and connects to it. In the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> documents,
a JDBC URL is referred to as a database connection URL.</p>
<p>After the driver is loaded, an application must specify the correct database
connection URL to connect to a specific database. The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
connection URL allows you to accomplish tasks other than simply connecting.
For more information about the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
connection URLs, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite>.</p>
<p>A JDBC URL always starts with <i>jdbc:</i>. After that, the format for
the database connection URL depends on the JDBC driver. </p>
<p>Here is the format for the database connection URL for connecting to an
existing <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
using the embedded driver:   <ul>
<li>jdbc:derby:<i>databaseName</i>;<i>URLAttributes</i></li>
</ul></p>
<p>The format for the database connection URL for connecting to an existing <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database using the
Network Client is:   <ul>
<li>jdbc:derby://<i>host:port</i>/<i>databaseName</i>;<i>URLAttributes</i></li>
</ul></p>
<p>The italicized items stand for something the user fills in:   <ul>
<li><i id="rtoolsijtools16246">databaseName</i>   <p>The name of the database
you want to connect to. This might also include the file system path to the
database.</p></li>
<li><i id="rtoolsijtools12861">URLAttributes</i>   <p>One or more of the supported
attributes of the database connection URL, such as <i>upgrade=true</i>, <i>create=true</i> or <i>territory=ll_CC</i>.
For more information, see "Setting attributes for the database connection URL"
in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p></li>
<li><i>host</i>   <p>The name of the machine where the server is running.
It can be the name of the machine or the address.</p></li>
<li><i id="rtoolsijtools27024">port</i>   <p>The port number used by the server
framework</p></li>
</ul></p>
<section id="ctoolsabtproto"><title>About Protocols</title> <p>Officially,
the portion of the database connection URL called the protocol is <i>jdbc:</i>,
just as<i> http://</i> is a protocol in Web URLs. However, the second portion
of the database connection URL (everything between <i>jdbc:</i> and <i>databaseName</i>),
which is called the subprotocol, is informally considered part of the protocol.
Later in this book you might see references to protocol. Consider protocol
to be everything that comes before <i>databaseName</i>.</p></section>
