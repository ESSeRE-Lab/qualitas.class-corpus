<title>Using sysinfo to check the classpath</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>sysinfo provides an argument (<i>-cp</i>) which can be
used to test the classpath.   
<codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo -cp 
[ [ embedded ][ server ][ client] [ tools ] [ anyClass.class ] ] </b></codeblock></p>
<p>If your environment is set up correctly, the utility shows output indicating
success.</p>
<p>You can provide optional arguments with <i>-cp</i> to
test different environments. Optional arguments to <i>-cp</i> are:  
<ul>
<li>embedded</li>
<li>server</li>
<li>client</li>
<li>tools</li>
<li><i>classname</i>.class </li>
</ul></p>
<p>If something is missing from your classpath, the utility indicates what
is missing. For example, if you neglected to include the directory containing
the class named <i>SimpleApp</i> to your classpath, the
utility would indicate this when the following command line was issued (type
all on one line):  
<codeblock><b>$ java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo -cp embedded SimpleApp.class</b>
FOUND IN CLASS PATH:

<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> embedded engine library (derby.jar)


NOT FOUND IN CLASS PATH:

user-specified class (SimpleApp)
(SimpleApp not found.)</codeblock></p>
</conbody></concept>
