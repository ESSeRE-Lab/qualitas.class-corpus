<conbody>
<p>In the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> documentation, we refer to three locales:  
<ul>
<li><i>Java System locale</i>  
<p>This is the locale of your machine, which is automatically
detected by your JVM.   For <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> tools, the Java system
locale determines the default locale.</p></li>
<li><i>Database territory</i>  
<p>This is the territory associated
with your database when it is created. By default, this is the same as the 
Java System locale. The database territory determines
the language of database errors.</p></li>
<li><i>Tools Session locale</i>  
    <p>This locale is associated with your session,
        when using <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
        tools such as <codeph>ij</codeph> or <codeph>dblook</codeph>.
        This locale determines the language of messages, as well as
the localized display format for numbers, dates, times, and timestamps.
You can use the
<codeph><xref href="rtoolsijlocale.dita#rtoolsijlocale">derby.ui.locale</xref></codeph>
property to specify the session locale that should be used.</p></li>
</ul></p>
