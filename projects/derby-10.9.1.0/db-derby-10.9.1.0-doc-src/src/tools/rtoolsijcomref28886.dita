<section><title>Description</title>
<p>Assumes that the value of the string is a valid file name, and redirects <codeph>ij</codeph> processing to read from that file until it ends or an <xref href="rtoolsijcomref33358.dita#rtoolsijcomref33358">Exit</xref> command is executed. If the end of the file is reached without <codeph>ij</codeph> exiting, reading will continue from the previous input source once
the end of the file is reached. Files can contain Run commands.</p>
<p><codeph>ij</codeph> prints out the statements in the file as it executes them.</p>
<p>Any changes made to the <codeph>ij</codeph> environment by the file are visible
in the environment when processing resumes.</p>

<codeblock>ij&gt; <b>run 'setupMenuConn.ij';</b>
ij&gt; -- this is setupMenuConn.ij
-- ij displays its contents as it processes file
ij&gt; connect 'jdbc:derby:menuDB';
ij&gt; autocommit off;
ij&gt; -- this is the end of setupMenuConn.ij
-- there is now a connection to menuDB and no autocommit.
-- input will now resume from the previous source.
