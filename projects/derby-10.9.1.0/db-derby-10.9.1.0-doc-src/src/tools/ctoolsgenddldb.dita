<title>Generating the DDL for a database</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The <codeph>dblook</codeph> utility generates all of the following objects when
generating the DDL for a database: 
<ul>
<li>Checks</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Indexes</li>
<li>Jar files</li>
<li>Keys (primary, foreign, and unique)</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
<li>Stored procedures</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Views</li>
</ul>
<note>When dblook runs against a database that has jar files
installed, it will create a new directory, called <codeph>DERBYJARS</codeph>, within
the current directory, and that is where it will keep copies of all of the
jars it encounters. In order to run the generated DDL as a script, this <codeph>DERBYJARS</codeph> directory must either 1) exist within the directory in which
it was created, or 2) be moved manually to another directory, in which case
the path in the generated DDL file must be manually changed to reflect to
the new location.</note></p>
<p>The <codeph>dblook</codeph> utility ignores any objects that have system schemas
(for example, SYS, SYSIBM), since DDL is not able to directly create nor modify
system objects.</p>
