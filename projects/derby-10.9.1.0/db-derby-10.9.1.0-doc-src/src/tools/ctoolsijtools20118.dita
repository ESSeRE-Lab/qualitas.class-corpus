<p>When you work with JDBC applications, you need to know about several concepts.
The most basic is the <i>connection</i>. A <i>JDBC connection</i> is the object
through which commands are sent to the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> engine
and responses are returned to the program. Establishing a <i>connection</i> to
a specific database is done by specifying a appropriate database <i>URL</i>.
The following sections provide background information to help in understanding
the Derby database connection URL.</p>
