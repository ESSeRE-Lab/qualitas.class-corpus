<conbody>
<p>Use the <codeph>PlanExporter</codeph> tool to export query plan data for
further analysis. The query plan data can be exported in a variety of formats:
</p>
<ul>
<li>XML, the base format for exported query plan data</li>
<li>HTML, which helps you view graphically the execution plans of complex
queries you have executed</li>
</ul>
<p>By using this tool, you can avoid querying XPLAIN style tables to get a 
basic idea of the query plan followed by the optimizer.</p>
<p>You can specify other query plan export formats by specifying an appropriate
XSL stylesheet to transform the query plan data, or you can export the
query plan data as XML, then reformat as appropriate using any external
XML-aware tool of your choice.</p>
<note>The <codeph>PlanExporter</codeph> tool is in an experimental stage.
The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> team welcomes
comments and feedback on how to improve it.</note>
