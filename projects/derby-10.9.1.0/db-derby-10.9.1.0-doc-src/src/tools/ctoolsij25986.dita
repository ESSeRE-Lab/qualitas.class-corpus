<title>Using ij commands</title>

<conbody>
<p>The primary purpose of ij is to allow the execution of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> SQL
statements interactively or via scripts. Since SQL statements can be quite
long, ij uses the semicolon to mark the end of a statement or command. All
statements and commands must be terminated with a semicolon. If you press
Return before terminating a statement or command, ij places a continuation
character (&gt;) at the beginning of the next line.</p>
<p>ij uses properties, listed in
<xref href="rtoolsijpropref29864.dita#rtoolsijpropref29864"></xref>, to simplify
its use. </p>
<p>ij also recognizes specialized commands that
provide additional features, such as the ability to create and test cursors
and prepared statements, transaction control, and more. For complete information
about ij commands, see
<xref href="rtoolsijcomref25570.dita#rtoolsijcomref25570"></xref>.</p>
