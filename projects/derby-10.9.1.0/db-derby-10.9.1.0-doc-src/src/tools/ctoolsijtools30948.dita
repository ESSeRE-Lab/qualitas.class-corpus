<conbody>
<p>Included with the product are some standalone Java tools and utilities
that make it easier to use and develop applications for <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
<p>These tools and utilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><ph><indexterm>ij<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm></ph>ij</i>
<p><codeph>ij</codeph> is <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s
interactive JDBC scripting tool. It is a simple utility for running scripts
against a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database.
You can also use it interactively to run ad hoc queries. <codeph>ij</codeph> provides
several commands for ease in accessing a variety of JDBC features.</p> <p><codeph>ij</codeph> can
be used in an embedded or a client/server environment.</p></li>
<li><i><ph><indexterm>sysinfo<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm></ph>sysinfo</i> 
 <p><codeph>sysinfo</codeph> provides information about your version of <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and your environment.</p></li>
<li><i><ph><indexterm>dblook<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm></ph>dblook</i> 
 <p><codeph>dblook</codeph> is <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s
Data Definition Language (DDL) Generation Utility, more informally called a schema dump
tool. It is a simple utility that dumps the DDL of a user-specified database
to either a console or a file. The generated DDL can then be used for such
things as recreating all or parts of a database, viewing a subset of a database's
objects (for example, those which pertain to specific tables and schemas),
or documenting a database's schema.</p></li>
<li><i><ph><indexterm>SignatureChecker<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm></ph>SignatureChecker</i>
<p>The <codeph>SignatureChecker</codeph> tool identifies any SQL functions
and procedures in a database that do not follow the SQL Standard argument
matching rules.</p></li></ul>
