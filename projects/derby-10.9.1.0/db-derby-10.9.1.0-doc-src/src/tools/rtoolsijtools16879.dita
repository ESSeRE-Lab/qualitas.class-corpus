<section><p>Before a JDBC application connects to a database, it must cause
the proper JDBC driver to be loaded in the Java session. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides
the following JDBC drivers for use with the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
engine:   <ul>
<li><i>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</i>   <p>For embedded environments,
when <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> runs in the
same JVM as the application. This is commonly referred to as the embedded
drvier.</p></li>
<li><i>org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver</i>   <p>For client/server environments
that use the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server. This is commonly referred to as the Network Client driver.</p></li>
</ul></p></section>
<section><p>You can use <codeph>ij</codeph> to connect to any database that
supplies a JDBC driver. For those databases, you would need to load the supplied
JDBC driver.</p></section>
