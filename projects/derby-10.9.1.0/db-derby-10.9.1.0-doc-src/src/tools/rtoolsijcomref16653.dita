<refsyn><title>Syntax</title> <codeblock><b>-- <i>Text</i></b>

<b>/* <i>Text</i> */</b>
</codeblock> </refsyn>
<section><title>Description</title> <p>You can use a double dash to create
a comment anywhere within an <codeph>ij</codeph> command line and as permitted
by the underlying connection within SQL commands. The comment is ended at
the first new line encountered in the text.</p> <p>Comments are ignored on
input and have no effect on the output displayed.</p> 
<p>You can also enclose text in <codeph>/*&nbsp;*/</codeph> characters to create 
either one-line or multi-line comments. Nested comments are permitted. 
For example, you could put lines like the following into a script named
<codeph>comment.sql</codeph>:
</p>
<codeblock>
/* start the file with a /* nested comment */ and see what happens */
connect 'jdbc:derby:newdb;create=true';
values 'hi!';
create table t (x int);
/* use a multi-line comment */
/*
insert into t values 1, 2, 3;
insert into t values 4, 5, 6;
*/
/* end the file with a comment */
values 'This is a test';
/* This is also a test */
</codeblock></section>
<example><title>Examples</title> <codeblock>ij&gt; -- this is a comment;
-- the semicolons in the comment are not taken as the end
-- of the command; for that, we put it outside the --:
<b>;</b>
ij&gt; </codeblock> 
<codeblock>
ij&gt; <b>run 'comment.sql';</b>
ij&gt; /* start the file with a /* nested comment */ and see what happens */
