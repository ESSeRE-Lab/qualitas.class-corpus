<title>Using the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> tools
and startup utilities</title>
<shortdesc>There are several tools and utilities that you might want to use
as you begin to work with <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. </shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>The tools that are included with <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> are <codeph>dblook</codeph>, <codeph>ij</codeph>,
and <codeph>sysinfo</codeph>. To run these tools see:</p>
<ul>
<li><xref href="tgsrunningsysinfo.dita#tgsrunningsysinfo"></xref></li>
<li><xref href="tgsrunningij.dita#tgsrunningij"></xref></li>
<li><xref href="tgsrunningdblook.dita#tgsrunningdblook"></xref></li>
</ul>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> includes a set
of scripts that you can use to start the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> tools.
The scripts are located in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph><filepath>/bin</filepath> directory.
When you run these scripts, your CLASSPATH environment variable is set if
you have not already set it, and remains set as long as you are running the
tool.</p>
<p>Most of the examples in this guide that show how to use the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> scripts
to launch the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> tools
assume that you are using the embedded mode of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
engine. Use the instructions below to run the scripts with the Network Server.</p>
<section><title>Running the scripts with the Network Server</title><p>To run
the scripts with the Network Server, use the following commands: <ul>
<li>For the <codeph>sysinfo</codeph> tool, issue the command  <codeblock>NetworkServerControl sysinfo</codeblock></li>
<li>For the <codeph>ij</codeph> tool, issue the command  <codeblock>set DERBY_OPTS=-Dij.protocol=jdbc:derby://localhost/</codeblock> and
then start <codeph>ij</codeph> by issuing the command <codeph>ij</codeph>.</li>
<li>For the <codeph>dblook</codeph> tool, call the script and specify the <codeph>-d</codeph> option
and the full connection URL to the Network Server database. For  example: <codeblock>dblook -d 'jdbc:derby://localhost/myDB;user=usr'</codeblock> </li>
</ul></p></section>
<section><title>Additional <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> utilities</title><p>In
addition, there are Derby utilities that are system procedures that you can
call by using the <codeph>ij</codeph> tool. For example, there are system
procedures that you can use to import and export external files. Instructions
on how to use these system procedures are included in the 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph> and the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p></section>
