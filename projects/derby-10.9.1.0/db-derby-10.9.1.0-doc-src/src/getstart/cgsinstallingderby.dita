<conbody>
<p>There are several distributions of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
including binary and source distributions for the latest official release
and for previous official releases.</p>
<p>The distributions are: <ul>
<li>The <i>bin</i> distribution contains scripts, demonstration programs,
documentation, and the optimized .jar files. These .jar files are the same
set of .jar files that are in the <i>lib</i> distribution. </li>
<li>The <i>lib</i> distribution contains an optimized, small footprint set
of the Derby .jar files for deployment. </li>
<li>The <i>lib-debug</i> distribution contains a larger footprint set of the
Derby .jar files that are useful for debugging or reporting issues.</li>
<li>The <i>src</i> distribution contains the source files that are used to
create the <i>bin</i>, <i>lib</i>, and <i>lib-debug</i> distributions.</li>
</ul></p>
<note type="important">The remainder of the instructions in this guide assume
that you have downloaded the <i>bin</i> distribution.</note>
