<section><p> This tutorial uses a series of activities designed to demonstrate
the use of  <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in the
embedded and client/server configurations. After performing these activities,
you will find <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
be an easy-to-use and fully functional relational database management system
(RDBMS). </p><title>Tutorial skills and software requirements</title><p>To
perform the tutorial activities, you do not need to have any prior knowledge
of Java software, the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API, or SQL. Each
activity provides the complete command syntax that you need to use for each
operation. Instructions include the syntax for both a UNIX Korn shell and
a Windows command prompt.  </p><p>This tutorial demonstrates, but does not
teach, the Java, JDBC and SQL code that is presented. If you want a deeper
understanding of these topics, you will need to consult additional reference
materials.</p><p>To perform the tutorial activities, you must have: <ul>
<li>A Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.4 or higher installed on your computer</li>
<li>The binary (<codeph>bin</codeph>) installation of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlongname"></ph> version <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#vers/shortversionnumber"></ph> installed on your computer</li>
<li>A basic knowledge of the computer command line interface:<ul>
<li>How to start a command shell or window</li>
<li>How to navigate the file system hierarchy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p> </section>
<section><title>System configuration</title><p>You should <xref href="tgssetupverify.dita#tgssetupverify">verify
the system configuration</xref> before you perform the tutorial activities.</p></section>
<section><title>Problems and feedback on the tutorial activities</title><p>If
you experience problems with any aspect of the tutorial activities, send an
e-mail message to <codeph>derby-user@db.apache.org</codeph>.  Someone from
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> community will
