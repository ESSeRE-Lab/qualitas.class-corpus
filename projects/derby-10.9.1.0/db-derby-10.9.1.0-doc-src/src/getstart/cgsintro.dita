<title>Introduction to Derby</title>
<shortdesc>Welcome to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>! <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is a full-featured, open
source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is based on Java
technology and SQL.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is written and
implemented completely in the Java programming language. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides
users with a small-footprint standards-based database engine that can be tightly
embedded into any Java based solution. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> ensures
data integrity and provides sophisticated transaction support. In the default
configuration there is no separate database server to be installed or maintained
by the end user.</p>
<p>
    The on-disk database format used by
    <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
    is portable and platform-independent.
    You can move <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
    databases from machine to machine without needing to
    modify the data.
    A <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
    application can include a pre-built, populated database if
    it needs to, and that database will work in any
    <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
    configuration.
</p>
<p>For more information about
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, visit the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> website at
<xref format="html" href="http://db.apache.org/derby/" scope="external">http://db.apache.org/derby</xref>.

<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Wiki and other
resources, such as the derby-users mailing list, where you can ask questions
about issues not covered in the documentation.</p>
<p>Before you install <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
you should understand the deployment options and system requirements.</p>
