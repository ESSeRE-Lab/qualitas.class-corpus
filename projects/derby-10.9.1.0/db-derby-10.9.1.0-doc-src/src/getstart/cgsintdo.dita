<title>Deployment options</title>
<shortdesc>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> software
distribution provides two basic deployment options (also referred to as <term>frameworks</term>),
the simple embedded option and the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server option.</shortdesc>

<dt>Embedded</dt>
<dd>Refers to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> being
started by a simple single-user Java application. With this option <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> runs
in the same Java virtual machine (JVM) as the application.  <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can
be almost invisible to the end user because it is started and stopped by the
application and often requires no administration.<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> documentation
often refers to this as the <term>embedded configuration</term> or <term>embedded
mode</term>.</p></dd>

<dt>Server (or Server-based)</dt>
<dd>Refers to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> being
started by an application that provides multi-user connectivity to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases
across a network. With this option <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> runs
in the Java virtual machine (JVM) that hosts the Server. Applications connect
to the Server from different JVMs to access the database. The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server is part of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> software
distribution and provides this type of framework for <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.
 <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> also works well
with other, independently developed Server applications. <p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> documentation
often refers to this as the <term>Network Server configuration</term> or <term>client/server
configuration</term>.</p></dd>
