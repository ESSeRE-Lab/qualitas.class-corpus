<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> runs embedded in
a server framework that allows multiple network connections. (The framework
itself starts an instance of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and
runs in an embedded environment. However, the client applications do not run
in the embedded environment.)</p>
<p>You can also embed <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
any Java server framework. </p>
<p>See the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph></cite> for
more information on how to run <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> on
a server.</p>
