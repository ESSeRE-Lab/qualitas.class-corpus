<title>Environments in which Derby can run</title>
<shortdesc>Before you configure your system to run <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
it is useful to understand something about the different environments in which <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can run, because these
environments affect the classpath, driver name, and database connection URL.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>See the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite> for
more information on <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> environments.</p>
