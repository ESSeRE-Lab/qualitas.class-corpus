<title>Derby Network Server examples</title>
<conbody>
<p>The <ph conref="gsconrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network Server
examples are located in the /demo/programs/nserverdemo/ directory. The following
programs demonstrate how to use the Network Server to set up an embedded connection
and client connections to connect to the same database: <ul>
<li>Simple Network Server sample <p>This example uses two programs to illustrate
how a client program that starts up in its own JVM can connect to the Network
Server that a server program has started. The client program (SimpleNetworkClientSample)
and the server program (SimpleNetworkServerSample) each run in their own,
separate JVMs. This example shows the <ph conref="gsconrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> jar
files that the client and the server need in order to use the Network Server.
The SimpleNetworkClientSample program also shows you how to use either the
DriverManager class or the DataSource class to establish client connections.</p></li>
<li>Network Server demo <p>This program (NsSample) starts the Network Server
and shows you how to establish both client/server and embedded connections
to the same database using the Network Server, all in one JVM.</p></li>
</ul></p>
