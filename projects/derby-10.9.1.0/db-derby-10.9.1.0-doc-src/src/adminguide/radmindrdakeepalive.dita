<refbody>
<section><p>Indicates whether SO_KEEPALIVE is enabled on sockets. The keepAlive
mechanism is used to detect when clients disconnect unexpectedly.  A <i>keepalive
probe</i> is sent to the client if a long time (by default, more than two
hours) passes with no other data being sent or received.
The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph>.drda.keepAlive property is used to detect and clean up connections for
clients on powered-off machines or clients that have disconnected unexpectedly.</p></section>
<section><p>If the property is set to false, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will
not attempt to clean up disconnected clients. The keepAlive mechanism might
be disabled if clients need to resume work without reconnecting even after
being disconnected from the network for some time. To disable keepAlive probes
on Network Server connections, set this property to false.</p></section>
