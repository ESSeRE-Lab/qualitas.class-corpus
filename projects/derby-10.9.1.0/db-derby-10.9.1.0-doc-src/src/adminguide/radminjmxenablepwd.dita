<p>Some JVMs include built-in support for JMX password authentication. For
example, with Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 or later, authentication is
enabled by default, and it is possible to specify a properties file that
contains usernames and passwords. The properties file syntax is the same as for
other Java properties files.</p>
<p><note>When authentication is enabled and a Java Security Manager is
installed, additional permissions may need to be granted to users in the
security policy used. See
<xref href="radminjmxenablepolicy.dita#radminjmxenablepolicy"></xref> for
details.</note></p>
<p>For example, you could create a password file called
<codeph>jmxremote.password</codeph>:</p>
<codeblock>## Defining two "roles", each with its own password
monitorRole  derbym
controlRole  derby</codeblock>
<p>The security of the password file relies on your file system's access control
mechanisms. The file must be readable by the owner only. Also, you may need to
change the permissions on the password file to be readable only by the user who
starts the server. To do this on Windows (NTFS), use a command like the
following:</p>
<codeblock><b>cacls jmxremote.password /P <i>username</i>:R</b></codeblock>
<p><note>FAT file systems do not support this feature.</note></p>
<p>The following example starts the Network Server on the command line with
built-in JMX password authentication enabled. SSL is disabled, meaning that JMX
information, including user names and passwords most likely will be transferred
unprotected on the computer network. The command line appears on multiple lines
to improve readability, but you would enter it as a single <codeph>java</codeph>
command.</p>
<p><note type="important">It is not recommended to disable SSL in production
environments.</note></p>
<codeblock><b>java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=jmxremote.password
-jar lib/derbyrun.jar server start</b></codeblock>
