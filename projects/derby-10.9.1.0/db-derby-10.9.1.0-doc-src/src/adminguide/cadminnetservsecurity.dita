<conbody>
<p>By default, the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server will only listen on the localhost. Clients must use the localhost host
name to connect. By default, clients cannot access the Network Server from
another host. To enable connections from other hosts, set the derby.drda.host
property, or start the Network Server with the <codeph><i>-h</i></codeph> option
in the <codeph><i>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start</i></codeph> command.</p>
<p>In the following example the server will listen only on localhost and clients
cannot access the server from another host.</p>
<codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start</b></codeblock>
<p>In the following example, the server runs on host machine <codeph><i>sampleserver.example.com</i></codeph> and
also listens for clients from other hosts. Clients must specify the server
in the URL or DataSource as sampleserver.example.com:</p>
<codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start 
   -h sampleserver.example.com</b></codeblock>
<p>To start the Network Server so that it will listen on all interfaces, start
with an IP address of <codeph><i>0.0.0.0</i></codeph>, shown in the following
example:  <codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start -h 0.0.0.0</b></codeblock></p>
<p>A server that is started with the <codeph><i>-h 0.0.0.0</i></codeph> option
will listen to client requests that originate from both <codeph><i>localhost</i></codeph> and
from other machines on the network.</p>
<p>However, administrative commands (for example, <codeph><i>org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl
shutdown</i></codeph>) can run only on the host where the server was started,
even if the server was started with the <codeph><i>-h</i></codeph> option.</p>
