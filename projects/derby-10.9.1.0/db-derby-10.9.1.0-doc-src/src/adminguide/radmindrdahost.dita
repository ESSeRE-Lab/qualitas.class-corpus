<section>Causes the Network Server to listen on a specific network interface.
This property allows multiple instances of Network Server to run on a single machine,
each using its own unique host:port combination. The host needs to be set
to enable remote connections. By default, the Network Server will listen only
on the loopback address. If the property is set to 0.0.0.0, Network Server
will listen on all interfaces. Ensure that you are running under the security
manager and that user authorization is enabled before you enable remote
connections with this property. </section>
