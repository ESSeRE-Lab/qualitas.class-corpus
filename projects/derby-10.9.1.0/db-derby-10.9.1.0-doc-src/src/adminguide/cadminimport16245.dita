<title>Importing and exporting data</title>
<shortdesc>You can import and export large amounts of data between files and
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database. Instead
of having to use INSERT and SELECT statements, you can use
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system procedures to
import data directly from files into tables and to export data from tables into
files.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
procedures import and export data in delimited data file format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the export system procedures to write data from a database to one
or more files that are stored outside of the database. You can use a procedure
to export data from a table into a file or export data from a SELECT statement
result into a file.</li>
<li>Use the import system procedures to import data from a file into a table.
If the target table already contains data, you can replace or append to the
existing data.</li>
</ul>
