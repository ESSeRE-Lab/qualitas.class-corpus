<p>You may wish to disable or restrict access to MBeans in security-conscious
environments. You can do this using either of the following techniques.</p>
<p>The first technique is to use the <codeph>stopManagement()</codeph> method of
<codeph>ManagementMBean</codeph>. This method unregisters all of the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> MBeans except
<codeph>ManagementMBean</codeph> itself, so it does not turn access off
completely.</p>
<p>The second technique is to run the Network Server with a custom security
policy that does not grant <codeph>derby.jar</codeph> the permissions needed to
register MBeans. For example, you can modify the Network Server's basic policy
(see <xref href="tadminnetservbasic.dita#tadminnetservbasic"></xref>) by
commenting out this section:</p>
<codeblock>// Allows access to Derby's built-in MBeans, within the domain
// org.apache.derby.
// Derby must be allowed to register and unregister these MBeans.
// It is possible to allow access only to specific MBeans, attributes or
// operations. To fine tune this permission, see the javadoc of
// javax.management.MBeanPermission or the JMX Instrumentation and Agent
// Specification.
//
permission javax.management.MBeanPermission
    "org.apache.derby.*#[org.apache.derby:*]",
    "registerMBean,unregisterMBean";</codeblock>
<p>If the permission to register MBeans is not granted to
<codeph>derby.jar</codeph>,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will silently skip
starting the management service at boot time.</p>
