<taskbody>
<context> <p>You can use the NetworkServerControl API to shut down the Network
Server from within a Java application. The name of the method that you use
to shutdown the Network Server is <codeph>shutdown()</codeph>.</p> </context>
<example>
<p>For example, the following command shuts down the Network Server
running on the current machine using the default port number (1527):</p>
<codeblock>
NetworkServerControl server = new NetworkServerControl();
server.shutdown();
</codeblock>
<p>To shut down a server running with user authentication, you need to use
a NetworkServerControl instance created with user credentials:</p>
<codeblock>
NetworkServerControl server = new NetworkServerControl(username, password);
server.shutdown();
</codeblock>
</example>
