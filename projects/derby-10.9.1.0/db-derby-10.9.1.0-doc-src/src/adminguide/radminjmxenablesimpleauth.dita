<section>
<p>Some JVMs support a simple access file system for controlling JMX access. An
access file is formatted the same way as password files (described in
<xref href="radminjmxenablepwd.dita#radminjmxenablepwd"></xref>), and associates
roles with an access level. Valid access levels are <codeph>readonly</codeph>
and <codeph>readwrite</codeph>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <codeph>readonly</codeph> level only allows the JMX client to read an
MBean's attributes and receive notifications.</li>
<li>The <codeph>readwrite</codeph> level also allows setting attributes,
invoking operations, and creating and removing MBeans.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use an access file for JMX authorization, specify the name of the access
file using a system property upon JVM startup:</p>
<codeblock>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=jmxremote.access</codeblock>
<p>The contents of such an access file may look like this:</p>
<codeblock>monitorRole   readonly
controlRole   readwrite</codeblock>
