<title>Connectivity configurations</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>There are several ways to embed <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
a server framework:</p>
<dl><dlentry>
<dt>Use the Network Server</dt>
<dd>This is the easiest way to provide connectivity to multiple users who
are accessing <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases
from different JVMs. The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server provides this kind of connectivity to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases
within a single system or over a network.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>Purchase another server framework</dt>
<dd>You can use <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> within
many server frameworks, such as IBM WebSphere Application Server.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>Write your own framework</dt>
<dd><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s flexibility
allows other configurations as well. For example, rather than embedding <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in a server that communicates
with a client that uses JDBC, you can embed <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> within
a servlet in a web server that communicates with a browser using HTTP.</dd>
