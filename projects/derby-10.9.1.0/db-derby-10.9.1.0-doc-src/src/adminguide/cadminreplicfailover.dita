<conbody>
<p>At any time, you can transform the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database that has the
slave role into a normal 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database that can
process transactions. This transformation from being a slave to becoming an
active <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database is
called <i>failover</i>. During failover, the slave applies the parts of the
transaction log that have not yet been processed. It then undoes operations that
belong to uncommitted transactions, resulting in a transaction-consistent state
that includes all transactions whose commit log record has been sent to the
slave.</p>
<p>You perform failover from the master system. To do so, you connect to the
database on the master system using
the <i>failover=true</i> connection URL attribute. For example, for a database
named <codeph>wombat</codeph>, you might specify the following connection URL:
</p>
<codeblock>
jdbc:derby:wombat;failover=true
</codeblock>
<p>If the network connection between the master system and the slave system is
lost, you can perform failover from the slave system.</p>
<p>See the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for details about the
<i>failover=true</i> attribute.</p>
<p>There is no automatic failover or restart of replication after one of the
instances has failed.</p>
