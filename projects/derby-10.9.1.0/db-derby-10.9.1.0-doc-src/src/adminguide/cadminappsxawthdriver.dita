<conbody>
<section><p>You can access XA support for the Network Server by using the
network client driver's XA DataSource interface.</p>
<p>The interface <codeph>org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource</codeph> is 
available on all supported Java SE platforms. If your client runs on the 
Java SE 6 platform, and if you want to use XA DataSource methods specific to 
the JDBC 4 API, use the DataSource named 
<codeph>org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource40</codeph>.
</p><p>
If your client is running on the Java SE 6 platform, all connection objects 
returned from the DataSource will be JDBC 4 connection objects, whether or not
you are using the DataSource whose name ends in "40".
</p></section>
<example><p>The following example illustrates how to obtain an XA connection
with the network client driver:</p><codeblock>import org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource;
import javax.sql.XAConnection;
...

XAConnection xaConnection = null;
Connection conn = null;

ClientXADataSource ds = new ClientXADataSource();

ds.setDatabaseName ("sample");
ds.setCreateDatabase("create");

ds.setServerName("localhost");
ds.setPortNumber(1527);

xaConnection = ds.getXAConnection("auser", "shhhh");

conn = xaConnection.getConnection();</codeblock></example>
