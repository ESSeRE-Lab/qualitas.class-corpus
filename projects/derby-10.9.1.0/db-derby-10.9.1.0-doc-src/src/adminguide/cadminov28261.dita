<conbody>
<p>To support multi-user access, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> utilizes
row-level locking. However, you can configure <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
use table-level locking in environments that have few concurrent transactions
(for example, a read-only database) . Table-level locking is preferable if
there are few or no writes to the server, while row-level locking is essential
for good performance if many clients write to the server concurrently. The <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> optimizer tunes lock
choice for queries automatically.</p>
