<title>Security mechanism options when user authentication is disabled on the 
Network Server</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>When user authentication is turned off in <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, you can use any
of the security mechanism options.</p>
<p>You must provide a user and password for all security mechanisms except <i>USER_ONLY_SECURITY</i>. However, because user authentication
is disabled in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> server, the user name and password that you supply does not have to be one recognized as valid by <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
</conbody></concept>
