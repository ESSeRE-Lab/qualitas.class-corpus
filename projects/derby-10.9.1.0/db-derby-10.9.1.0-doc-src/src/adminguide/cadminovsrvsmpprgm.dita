<conbody>
<p>The SimpleNetworkServerSample program starts the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server, as well as the embedded driver, and waits for clients to connect. The
program performs the following tasks.
<ul>
<li>Starts the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network Server by using a property and also loads the embedded driver</li>
<li>Determines if the Network Server is running</li>
<li>Creates the NSSimpleDB database if it is not already
created</li>
<li>Obtains an embedded database connection </li>
<li>Tests the database connection by executing a sample query</li>
<li>Allows client connections to connect to the server until you decide to
stop the server and exit the program</li>
<li>Closes the connection</li>
<li>Shuts down the Network Server before exiting the program</li>
</ul></p>
<p> To run the sample program, install the following files in
the <codeph>%<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph>%\demo\nserverdemo\</codeph> directory:
<ul>
<li>The source file: <filepath>SimpleNetworkServerSample.java</filepath></li>
<li>The compiled class file: <filepath>SimpleNetworkServerSample.class</filepath></li>
</ul></p>
