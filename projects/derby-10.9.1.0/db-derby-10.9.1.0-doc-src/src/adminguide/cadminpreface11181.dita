<title>Purpose of this guide</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>This guide explains how to use <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in a multiple-client environment.
It also provides information that a server administrator might need to keep
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> running with a high level of performance and reliability in a server framework
or in a multiple-client application server environment (When running in embedded mode, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
databases typically do not need any administration).</p>
<p>To connect multiple clients with <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, you can embed <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in a server
framework that you choose, or you can use the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network Server. This
guide describes these options.</p>
