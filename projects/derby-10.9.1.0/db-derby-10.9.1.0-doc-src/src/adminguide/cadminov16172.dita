<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> supports SERIALIZABLE
(RR), REPEATABLE (RS), READ COMMITTED (CS), and READ UNCOMMITTED (UR) isolation
levels.</p>
<dl><dlentry>
<dt>CS</dt>
<dd>CS (the default isolation level) provides the best balance between concurrency
and consistency in multiple-client environments.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>RS</dt>
<dd>RS provides less consistency than RR but allows more concurrency.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>RR</dt>
<dd>RR provides greatest consistency.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>UR</dt>
<dd>UR provides maximum concurrency, if uncommitted values are allowed in
the query. It is typically used if approximate results are acceptable.</dd>
