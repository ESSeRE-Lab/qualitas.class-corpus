<title>Backing up a database</title>
<shortdesc>You can back up a database either offline (when it is shut down) or
online (when it is running).</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>After you back up a database, make sure the backup copy is not corrupt. To
do this, run the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE system function on all the tables
in the backup copy. Do not discard the previous backup until you have verified
the consistency of the current one. See
<xref href="cadminconsist01.dita#cadminconsist01"></xref> for more
information.</p>
<p>The topics in this section describe how to back up a database.</p>
