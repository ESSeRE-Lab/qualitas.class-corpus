<title>When the log is in a non-default location</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<note>Read <xref href="cadminlog98.dita#cadminlog98"></xref> to find out about
the default location of the database log.</note>
<p>If you put the database log in a non-default location prior to backing
up the database, be aware of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using an operating system command to back up the database,
you must explicitly copy the log file as well, as shown in the following example:
  <codeblock>xcopy d:\mydatabases\sample c:\mybackups\2012-04-01\sample /s /i
xcopy h:\janet\tourslog\log c:\mybackups\2012-04-01\sample\log /s /i</codeblock></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not using Windows, substitute the appropriate operating system
command for copying a directory and all of its contents to a new location.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the <i>logDevice</i> entry in <i>service.properties</i> of the database
backup so that it points to the correct location for the log. In the previous
example, the log was moved to the default location for a log, so you can remove
the <i>logDevice</i> entry entirely, or leave the <i>logDevice</i> entry as is and wait
until the database is restored to edit the entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <xref href="cadminlog98.dita#cadminlog98"></xref> for information about
putting the log in a non-default location.</p>
