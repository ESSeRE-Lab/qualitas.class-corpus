<conbody>
<p>When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> creates new
files, the visibility of the new file (that is, which users can access it) is
normally determined by the JVM environment and the file location only (that is,
by the umask setting on UNIX and Linux systems and by the default file
permissions on Windows NTFS).</p>
<p>On Java SE 7 or later,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> may further restrict
the file permissions to the operating system account that started the Java
process (that is, to the minimum access needed for operation). This means that
other operating system accounts will have no access to directories or files
created by <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. This
behavior can be helpful in enhancing default security for database files.</p>
<p>The exact behavior is determined by two factors: how the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> engine is started, and
the presence or absence and specified value of the property
<codeph>derby.storage.useDefaultFilePermissions</codeph>.</p>
<p>The two tables that follow show how file access works with Java SE 6 and with
Java SE 7 and later JVMs. In both tables,</p>
<ul>
<li>"Environment" means that access is controlled entirely by the JVM
environment and the file location only (that is, by the umask setting on UNIX
and Linux systems and by the default file permissions on Windows NTFS).</li>
<li>"Restricted" means that
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> restricts access to the
operating system account that started the JVM.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows how file access works on Java SE 6 systems.</p>
