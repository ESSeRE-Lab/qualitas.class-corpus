<title>Derby in a server framework</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>In a sense, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is
always an embedded product. You can embed it in an application in which users
access the database from a single JVM or you can embed it in a server framework
(an application that allows users from different JVMs to connect to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> simultaneously).
When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is embedded
in an application, the local JDBC driver calls the local <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database.
When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is embedded
in a server framework, the server framework's connectivity software provides
data to multiple client JDBC applications over a network or the Internet.</p>
<p>For local or remote multi-user connectivity (multiple users who access <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> from different JVMs),
use the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server. If you require features that are not included in the Network Server,
you can embed the basic <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> product
in another server framework.</p>
