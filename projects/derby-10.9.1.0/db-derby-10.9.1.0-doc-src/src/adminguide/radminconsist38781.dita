<section><p>If the row counts of the base table and an index differ, error
message X0Y55 is issued:</p></section>
<example> <codeblock>ERROR X0Y55: The number of rows in the base table does not match 
the number of rows in at least 1 of the indexes on the table. Index 
'T1_I' on table 'APP.T1' has 4 rows, but the base table has 5 rows. 
The suggested corrective action is to recreate the index.</codeblock></example>
<section><p>If the index refers to a row that does not exist in the base table,
error message X0X62 is issued:</p></section>
<example> <codeblock>ERROR X0X62: Inconsistency found between table 'APP.T1' and index
'T1_I'. Error when trying to retrieve row location '(1,6)' from the 
table. The full index key,including the row location, is '{ 1, (1,6) }'.
The suggested corrective action is to recreate the index.</codeblock></example>
<section><p>If a key column value differs between the base table and the index,
error message X0X61 is issued:</p></section>
<example> <codeblock>ERROR X0X61: The values for column 'C10' in index 'T1_C10' and 
table 'APP.T1' do not match for row location (1,7). The value in the 
index is '2 2   ', while the value in the base table is 'NULL'. The full
index key, including the row location, is '{ 2 2       , (1,7) }'. The 
suggested corrective action is to recreate the index.</codeblock></example>
