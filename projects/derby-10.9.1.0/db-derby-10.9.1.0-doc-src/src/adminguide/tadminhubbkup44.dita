<shortdesc>To restore a database by using a full backup from a specified location,
specify the <codeph>restoreFrom=<i>Path</i></codeph> attribute in the boot
time connection URL.</shortdesc>
<taskbody>
<context><p>If a database with the same name exists in the derby.system.home
location, the system will delete the database, copy it from the backup location,
and then restart it.</p><p>The log files are copied to the same location they
were in when the backup was taken. You can use the <codeph>logDevice</codeph> attribute
in conjunction with the <codeph>restoreFrom=<i>Path</i></codeph> attribute
to store logs in a different location.</p></context>
<example> For example, to restore the sample database by using a backup copy
in <filepath>c:\mybackups\sample</filepath>, the connection URL should be: <codeblock>jdbc:derby:sample;restoreFrom=c:\mybackups\sample</codeblock>
