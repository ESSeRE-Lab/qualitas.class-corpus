<title>Running the Network Server without a security policy</title>
<prolog><metadata>

<taskbody>

<p>
You may override the Network Server's impulse to install a security
manager if, for some reason, you need to run your application outside
Java's security protections.
</p>

<note othertype="" type="caution">
You incur a severe security risk by opening
up the server to all clients without limiting access via user
authentication and a security policy.
</note>

<p>
Use the <i>-noSecurityManager</i> option to force the Network Server
to come up without a security manager. E.g.:
</p>

<codeblock>
java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start -h localhost -noSecurityManager
</codeblock>

</context>

</task>
