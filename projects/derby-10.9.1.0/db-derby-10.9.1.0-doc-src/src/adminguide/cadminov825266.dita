<title>The Derby Network Server</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server provides multi-user connectivity to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases
within a single system or over a network. The Network Server uses the standard
Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) protocol to receive and
reply to queries from clients. Databases are accessed through the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server by using the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Client driver.</p>
<p>The Network Server is a solution for multiple JVMs that connect to the
database, unlike the embedded scenario where only one JVM runs as part of
the system. When <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is
embedded in a single-JVM application, the embedded JDBC driver calls the local <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database. When <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is embedded in a server
framework, the server framework's connectivity software provides data to multiple
client JDBC applications over a network or the Internet.</p>
<p>To run the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server, you need to install the following files:<ul>
<li>On the server side, install <filepath>derby.jar</filepath> and <filepath>derbynet.jar</filepath>.</li>
<li>On the client side, install <filepath>derbyclient.jar</filepath>.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>There are several ways to manage the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the command line</li>
<li>By using .bat and .ksh scripts</li>
<li>With your own Java program (written using the Network Server API)</li>
<li>By setting Network Server properties</li>
</ul>
<p><xref href="cadminapps59125.dita#cadminapps59125"></xref> explains how
to change existing Java applications that currently run against <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
embedded mode to run against the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server.</p>
<p><xref href="cadminconfig86869.dita#cadminconfig86869"></xref> explains
how to manage the Network Server by using the command line, including starting
and stopping it.</p>
<p><xref href="cadminadvtops.dita#cadminadvtops"></xref> contains advanced
topics for <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
Server users.</p>
<p>Because of the differences in JDBC drivers that are used, you might encounter
differences in functionality when running <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
the Network Server framework as opposed to running it embedded in a user application.
Refer to <xref href="cadminapps59125.dita#cadminapps59125"></xref> for a complete
list of the differences between embedded and Network Server configurations.</p>
