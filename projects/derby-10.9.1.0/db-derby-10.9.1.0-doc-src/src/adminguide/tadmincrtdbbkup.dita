<title>Creating a database from a backup copy</title>
<shortdesc>To create a database from a full backup copy at a specified location,
specify the <codeph>createFrom=<i>Path</i></codeph> attribute in the boot
time connection URL.</shortdesc>

<keywords><indexterm>Creating a database from a backup copy</indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<taskbody>
<context> <p>If there is already a database with the same name in derby.system.home,
an error will occur and the existing database will be left intact. If there
is not an existing database with the same name in the current derby.system.home
location, the system will copy the whole database from the backup location
to derby.system.home and start it.</p><p>The log files are also copied to
the default location. You can use the <codeph>logDevice</codeph> attribute
in conjunction with the <codeph>createFrom=Path</codeph> attribute to store
logs in a different location. With the <codeph>createFrom=Path</codeph> attribute,
you do not need to copy the individual log files to the log directory.</p> </context>
<example>For example, to create the sample database from a backup copy in <filepath>c:\mybackups\sample</filepath>,
the connection URL should be:  <codeblock>jdbc:derby:sample;createFrom=c:\mybackups\sample</codeblock>
<p>For more information, see "createFrom=path attribute" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
