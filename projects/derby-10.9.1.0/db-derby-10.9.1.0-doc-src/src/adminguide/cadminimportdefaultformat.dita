<title>File format for input and output</title>

<conbody>
<p>The default file format is a delimited text file with the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rows are separated by a newline</li>
<li>Fields are separated by a comma (<codeph>,</codeph>)</li>
<li>Character-based fields are delimited with double quotes
(<codeph>"</codeph>)</li>
</ul>
<note type="restriction">Before you perform import or export operations, you
must ensure that the chosen delimiter character is not contained in the data
to be imported or exported. If you chose a delimiter character that is part
of the data to be imported or exported, unexpected errors might occur. The
following restrictions apply to column and character delimiters:
<ul>
<li>Delimiters are mutually exclusive</li>
<li>A delimiter cannot be a line-feed character, a carriage return, or a blank
space</li>
<li>The default decimal point (<codeph>.</codeph>) cannot be a character
delimiter</li>
<li>Delimiters cannot be hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f, A-F).</li>
</ul></note>
<p>The record delimiter is assumed to be a newline character. The record
delimiter should not be used as any other delimiter.</p>
<p>Character delimiters are permitted with the character-based fields (CHAR,
VARCHAR, and LONG VARCHAR) of a file during import. Any pair of character
delimiters found between the enclosing character delimiters is imported into
the database. For example, suppose that you have the following character string:
<codeblock>"What a ""great"" day!"</codeblock>
The preceding character string gets imported into the database as:
<codeblock>What a "great" day!</codeblock></p>
<p>During export, the rule applies in reverse. For example, suppose you have
the following character string:
<codeblock>"The boot has a 3" heel."</codeblock>
The preceding character string gets exported to a file as:
<codeblock>"The boot has a 3""heel."</codeblock></p>
<p>The following example file shows four rows and four columns in the default
file format:
<codeblock>1,abc,22,def
22,,,"a is a zero-length string, b is null"
13,"hello",454,"world"
4,b and c are both null,,</codeblock></p>
<p>The export procedure outputs the following values:
<codeblock>1,"abc",22,"def"
22,,,"a is a zero-length string, b is null"
13,"hello",454,"world"
4,"b and c are both null",,</codeblock></p>
