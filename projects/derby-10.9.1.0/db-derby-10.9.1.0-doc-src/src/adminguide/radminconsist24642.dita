<refbody>
<section><p>This section provides examples that illustrate how to use the
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE function in queries.</p></section>
<section><p>To check the consistency of a single table, run a query that is
similar to the one shown in the following example:</p></section>
<example><codeblock>VALUES SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTS')</codeblock></example>
<section><p>To check the consistency of all of the tables in a schema, stopping
at the first failure, run a query that is similar to the one shown in the
following example:</p></section>
<example><codeblock>SELECT tablename, SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE(
    'SAMP', tablename)
FROM sys.sysschemas s, sys.systables t
WHERE s.schemaname = 'SAMP' AND s.schemaid = t.schemaid</codeblock></example>
<section><p>To check the consistency of an entire database, stopping at the
first failure, run a query that is similar to the one shown in the following
example::</p></section>
<example><codeblock>SELECT schemaname, tablename,
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE(schemaname, tablename)
FROM sys.sysschemas s, sys.systables t
WHERE s.schemaid = t.schemaid</codeblock></example>
