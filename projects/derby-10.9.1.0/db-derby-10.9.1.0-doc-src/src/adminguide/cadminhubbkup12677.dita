<title>Offline backups</title>
<shortdesc>To perform an offline backup of a database, use operating system
commands to copy the database directory.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p><note type="important">You must shut down the database before you perform an
offline backup.</note></p>
<p>For example, on Windows systems, the following operating system command 
backs up a (closed) database that is named <i>sample</i> and that is located in <filepath>d:\mydatabases</filepath> by
copying it to the directory <filepath>c:\mybackups\2012-04-01</filepath>:</p>
<codeblock>xcopy d:\mydatabases\sample c:\mybackups\2012-04-01\sample /s /i</codeblock>
<p>If you are not using Windows, substitute the appropriate operating
system command for copying a directory and all contents to a new location.</p>
<note>On Windows systems, do not attempt to update a database while it is being
backed up in this way. Attempting to update a database during an offline
backup will generate a java.io.IOException. Using online backups prevents
this from occurring.</note>
<p>For large systems, shutting down the database might not be convenient.
To back up a database without having to shut it down, you can use an online backup.</p>
<p>After you back up a database, make sure the backup copy is not corrupt. To
do this, run the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE system function on all the tables
in the backup copy. Do not discard the previous backup until you have verified
the consistency of the current one. See
<xref href="cadminconsist01.dita#cadminconsist01"></xref> for more
information.</p>
