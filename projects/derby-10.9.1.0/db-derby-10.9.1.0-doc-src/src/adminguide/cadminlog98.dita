<title>Logging on a separate device</title>
<shortdesc>You can improve the performance of update-intensive,
large databases by putting a database's log on a separate device, which
reduces I/O contention.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>By default, the transaction log is in the <i>log</i> subdirectory
of the database directory. Use either of the following methods to store this <i>log</i> subdirectory in another location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify the non-default location by using the <i>logDevice=logDirectoryPath</i> attribute on the database connection URL when you create the database.</li>
<li>If the database is already created, move the log manually and update the <i>service.properties</i> file.</li>
</ul>
</conbody></concept>
