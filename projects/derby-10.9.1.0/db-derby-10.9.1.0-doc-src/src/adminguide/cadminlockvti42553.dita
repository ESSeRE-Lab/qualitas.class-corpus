<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides a tool
to monitor and display locking information. This tool can help you create
applications that minimize deadlock. It can also help you locate the cause
of deadlock when it does occur.</p>
<p>To diagnose locking problems, constantly monitor locking traffic by logging
all deadlocks by using the derby.locks.monitor property.</p>
