<title>Updatable result sets</title>
<conbody>
<p>In <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, the
functionality of updatable result sets in a server environment and in an
embedded environment are similar, with the exception of the following
differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Network Client requires that there be at least one column in the select
list from the target table. For example, the following statement will fail
in a server environment:<codeblock>select 1, 2 from t1 for update of c11</codeblock>The
Network Client driver looks at both of the columns in the select list and
cannot determine the target table for update/delete by looking at the column
metadata. This requirement is not necessary in an embedded environment.</li>
<li>The embedded driver allows for statement name changes when there is an
open result set on the statement object. This is not supported in a server
environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other differences between updatable result sets in a server or embedded
environment can be found in the following table.</p>
