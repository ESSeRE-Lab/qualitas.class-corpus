<title>Differences in JDBC 3.0 methods</title>

driver</indexterm></indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The following JDBC 3.0 methods are supported only with the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> embedded driver. 
Attempts to call these methods with the network client driver will result in 
a "not implemented" error.
</p>
<pre>
Connection.prepareStatement(String sql, String[] columnNames)
Connection.prepareStatement(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)

Statement.execute(String sql, String[] columNames)
Statement.execute(String sql, int[] columIndexes)
Statement.executeUpdate(String sql, String[] columnNames)
Statement.executeUpdate(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)
</pre>
<p>For more on the use of these methods, see the sections "java.sql.Connection 
interface: supported JDBC 3.0 methods", "java.sql.Statement interface: 
supported JDBC 3.0 methods", and "Autogenerated keys" in the 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
