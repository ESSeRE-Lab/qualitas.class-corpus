<title>Turning on the trace facility</title>
<taskbody>
<steps>
<step><cmd>Turn on tracing for all sessions by specifying the following property:</cmd>
<stepxmp><codeblock>derby.drda.traceAll=true </codeblock>Alternatively, while
the Network Server is running, you can use the following command to turn on
the trace facility:<codeblock>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl
   trace on [-s &lt;<i>connection number</i>&gt;] [-h &lt;<i>hostname</i>&gt;][-p &lt;<i>portnumber</i>&gt;] </codeblock></stepxmp>
<info>If you specify a &lt;<i>connection number</i>&gt;, tracing will be turned
on only for that connection.</info></step>
<step><cmd>Set the location of the tracing files by specifying the following
property:</cmd><stepxmp><codeblock>derby.drda.traceDirectory=&lt;<i>directory for tracing files</i>&gt;</codeblock>
Alternatively,
while the Network Server is running, enter the following command
to set the trace directory:<codeblock>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl traceDirectory 
&lt;<i>directory for tracing files</i>&gt; [-h &lt;<i>hostname</i>&gt;] [-p &lt;<i>portnumber</i>&gt;]  </codeblock> 
<p>You need to specify only the directory where the tracing files will
reside. The names of the tracing files are determined by the system. If you
do not set a trace directory, the tracing files will be placed in derby.system.home.</p>
<p>
    The Network Server will attempt to create the trace directory
    (and any parent directories) if they do not exist.
    This will require that the Java security policy for 
    <codeph>derbynet.jar</codeph>
    permits verification of the existence of the named trace directory
    and all necessary parent directories.
    For each directory created, the policy must allow
    <codeblock>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "&lt;<i>directory</i>&gt;", "read,write";
    </codeblock>
    and for the trace directory itself, the policy must allow
    <codeblock>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "&lt;<i>tracedirectory</i>&gt;${/}-", "write";
    </codeblock>
</p>
<p>
    See <xref href="tadminnetservcustom.dita#tadminnetservcustom"></xref> for
    information about customizing the Network Server's security policy.
