<title>Managing the Derby Network Server</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network
    Server can be run in either of these configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As <xref format="html" scope="external"
                href="http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/ns_intro.html#ns_intro">a stand-alone server</xref>,
            in which case it is an independent Java process embedding the 
            <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> 
            database engine</li>
        <li>As <xref format="html" scope="external"
                href="http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/ns_intro.html#Embedded+Server">an embedded server</xref>,
            in which case it is embedded within another Java application,
            and both the Network Server framework and the 
            <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> 
            database engine are loaded by the Java application</li>
    </ul>
<p>You can use Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology to monitor and manage
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and the Network Server.
For information on how to do this, see
<xref href="cadminjmxoverview.dita#cadminjmxoverview"></xref>.</p>
<p>
You can manage the Network Server by using shell scripts, the command line,
or the Network Server API.</p>
