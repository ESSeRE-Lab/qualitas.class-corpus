<title>Stopping replication</title>

<conbody>
<p>To stop replication of a database, connect to the master database using the
<i>stopMaster=true</i> connection URL attribute. The master sends the remaining
log records that await shipment, and then sends a stop replication command to
the slave. The slave then writes all logs to disk and shuts down the database.
For example, for a database named <codeph>wombat</codeph>, you might specify the
following connection URL:</p>
<codeblock>
jdbc:derby:wombat;stopMaster=true
</codeblock>
<p>To stop replication on the slave system if the connection to the master is
lost, use the <i>stopSlave=true</i> connection URL attribute.
</p>
<p>See the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for details about these
attributes.</p>
<p>You cannot resume replication after it has been stopped. You need to start
replication over again from the beginning using the <i>startMaster=true</i>
attribute, as described in
<xref href="cadminreplicstartrun.dita#cadminreplicstartrun"></xref>.
