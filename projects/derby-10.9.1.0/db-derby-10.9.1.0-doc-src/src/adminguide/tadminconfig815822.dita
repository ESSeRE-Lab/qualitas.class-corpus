method</indexterm></indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<taskbody>
<context> <p>The getCurrentProperties method is a Java method that you can
use to obtain information about the Network Server. It returns a Properties
object with the value of all the Network Server properties as they are currently
set.</p><p>The signature of this method is:<codeblock>Properties getCurrentProperties();</codeblock></p></context>
<example>For example:<codeblock>NetworkServerControl server = new NetworkServerControl();
Properties p = server.getCurrentProperties();
p.list(System.out);
System.out.println(p.getProperty("derby.drda.host"));</codeblock><p>As shown
in the previous example, you can look up the current properties and then work
with individual properties if needed by using various APIs on the Properties
class. You can also print out all the properties by using the Properties.list()
method.</p></example>
