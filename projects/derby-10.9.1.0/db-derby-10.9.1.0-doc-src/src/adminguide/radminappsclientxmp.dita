<title>Network client driver examples</title>

<section>
<p>The following examples specify the user and password URL attributes. 
To enable user authentication, you must either use NATIVE authentication or
explicitly set the property <i>derby.connection.requireAuthentication</i>
to true. Otherwise, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
does not require a user name and password. For details on how to enable
user authentication, see "Working with user authentication" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"/>.</p>
<p>For a multi-user product, you would typically specify authentication for the
system in the <i>derby.properties</i> file for your
server, since it is in a trusted environment. The following property setting
specifies NATIVE authentication:</p>
<codeblock>derby.authentication.provider=NATIVE:myCredentialsDB:LOCAL</codeblock>
<p><note type="important">It is strongly recommended that production systems
rely on NATIVE authentication, an external directory service such as LDAP, or a
user-defined class for authentication. It is also strongly recommended that
production systems protect network connections with SSL/TLS.</note></p>
</section>
<section><title>Example 1</title><p>The following example connects to the
default server name localhost on the default port, 1527, and to the database
sample.</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sample;user=judy;password=no12see</codeblock></section>
<section><title>Example 2</title><p>The following example specifies both <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and Network Client
driver attributes:  <codeblock>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sample;create=true;user=judy;
password=no12see</codeblock></p></section>
<section><title>Example 3</title><p>This example connects to the default server
name localhost on the default port, 1527, and includes the path in the database
name portion of the URL.</p><codeblock>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/c:/my-db-dir/my-db-name;user=judy;
password=no12see</codeblock>
<p>For a programming example that shows how to connect to the server using
NATIVE authentication, see "NATIVE authentication and SQL authorization example"
in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"/>.</p>
