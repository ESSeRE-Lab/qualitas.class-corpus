<conbody>
<p>In the embedded mode, when the Connection.setReadOnly method has <codeph>true</codeph> as
the parameter, the connection is marked as a read-only connection. When using
a Network Server, the Connection.setReadOnly(true) method is ignored and the
connection is not marked as a read-only connection.</p>
