<title>Checking database consistency</title>
<shortdesc>After you perform a backup, or if you experience hardware or
operating system failure, you can use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE system
function to verify that the database is still consistent.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>It is recommended that you run SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE on all the tables
in a database offline after you back it up. Do not discard the previous backup
until you have verified the consistency of the current one. Otherwise, check
consistency only if there are indications that such a check is needed, because a
consistency check can take a long time on a large database.</p>
<p>See the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for details about this
system function.</p>
