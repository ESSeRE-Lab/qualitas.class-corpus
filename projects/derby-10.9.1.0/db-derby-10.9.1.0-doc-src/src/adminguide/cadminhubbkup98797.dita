<conbody>
<p>To back up a database, you can do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shut down the database and use operating system commands to copy it to a
backup location, as described in
<xref href="cadminhubbkup12677.dita#cadminhubbkup12677"></xref>.</li>
<li>Leave the database running and call one of four system backup procedures to copy
it to a backup location, as described in
<xref href="cadminhubbkup01.dita#cadminhubbkup01"></xref>.</li>
<li>Leave the database running, but call a system procedure to freeze the
database, use operating system commands to copy it to a backup location, then
call a system procedure to unfreeze the database, as described in
<xref href="cadminhubbkup75469.dita#cadminhubbkup75469"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To restore a database from a backup copy, you must use one of three
connection URL attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><codeph>restoreFrom=<i>path</i></codeph>, described in
<xref href="tadminhubbkup44.dita#tadminhubbkup44"></xref></li>
<li><codeph>createFrom=<i>path</i></codeph>, described in
<xref href="tadmincrtdbbkup.dita#tadmincrtdbbkup"></xref></li>
<li><codeph>rollForwardRecoveryFrom=<i>path</i></codeph>, described in
<xref href="cadminrollforward.dita#cadminrollforward"></xref></li>
</ul>
