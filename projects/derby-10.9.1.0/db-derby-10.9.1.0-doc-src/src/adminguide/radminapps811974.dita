<section><p>The Network Server reports only the first error or warning message
if multiple errors or warnings occur for a given statement. For example: <codeblock>ij&gt; create table ai (x int, y int generated always as identity
	(increment by 200000000));
ij&gt; insert into ai (x) values (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),
(8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(15),(16),(17),(18),(19);</codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>The Network Server generates the following error message and appends
the exception message to the error: <codeblock>ERROR 42Z24: Overflow occurred in identity for column 'Y' in table 'AI':
SQLSTATE: 22003: The resulting value is outside the range 
for the data type INTEGER.</codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> embedded
driver, however, would generate two SQL exceptions:<codeblock>ERROR 42Z24: Overflow occurred in identity for column 'Y' in table 'AI'. 
</codeblock> <codeblock>ERROR 22003: The resulting value is outside the range for the data type INTEGER.</codeblock></p></section>
<section><p>This is because the network client driver reports only one SQLException
or one SQLWarning per statement.</p></section>
