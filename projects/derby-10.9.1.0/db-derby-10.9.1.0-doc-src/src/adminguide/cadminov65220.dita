<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> allows multiple simultaneous connections to a database, even
in embedded mode. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is also fully multi-threaded, and you can have
multiple threads active at the same time. However, JDBC semantics impose some
limitations on multi-threading. See the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite> for more information.</p>
