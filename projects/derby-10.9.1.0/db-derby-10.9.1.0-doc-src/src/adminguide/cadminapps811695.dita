<conbody>
<p>To use the encrypted user ID and password security mechanism,
you need a Java environment with a JCE (Java Cryptography Extension)
which supports the Diffie-Hellman algorithm with a public prime of
256 bits. The Sun Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), Version
1.4 and later requires a public prime of 512 bits or
more.</p>
<p>To use the encrypted user id and password security mechanism during
JDBC connection using the network client, specify the <codeph>securityMechanism</codeph> in
the connection property. <note>If an encrypted database is booted in
the Network Server, users can connect to the database without giving the <codeph>bootPassword</codeph>.
The first connection to the database must provide the <codeph>bootPassword</codeph>,
but all subsequent connections do not need to supply it. To remove access
from the encrypted database, use the <codeph>shutdown=true</codeph> option
to shut down the database.</note></p>
