<title>Example of moving a log manually</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<refbody>
<section><p>If you want to move the log to <filepath>g:/bigdisk/tourslog</filepath>, move the log with operating system commands:</p></section><example>
<codeblock><b>move h:\janets\tourslog\log\*.* g:\bigdisk\tourslog\log</b></codeblock></example>
<section><p>Then, alter the <i>logDevice </i>entry in <i>service.properties</i> to read as follows:</p></section><example>
<codeblock>logDevice=g:/bigdisk/toursLog</codeblock></example><section>
<note>You can use either a single forward slash or double back slashes
for a path separator.</note></section>
<section><p>If you later want to move the log back to its default location (in this
case, <filepath>d:\mydatabases\toursDB\log</filepath>), move
the log manually as follows:</p></section><example>
<codeblock><b>move g:\bigdisk\tourslog\log\*.* d:\mydatabases\toursDB\log</b></codeblock></example>
<section><p>Then, delete the <i>logDevice </i>entry from <i>service.properties.</i></p></section><section>
<note>This example uses commands that are specific to the Windows NT operating
system. Use commands appropriate to your operating system to copy a directory
and all of its contents to a new location.</note></section>
