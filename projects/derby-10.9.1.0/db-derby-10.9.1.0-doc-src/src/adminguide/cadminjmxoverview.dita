<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> includes a set of
MBeans (Managed Beans) and their attributes and operations, providing monitoring
and management capabilities. Before using the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> MBeans, you should have
a basic understanding of JMX technology. A good source of information is the
"Monitoring and Management for the Java Platform" web page at <xref format="html"
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/"
scope="external">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/
</xref>.</p>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> MBeans
instrument one or more parts of a running
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system. This
instrumentation gives you real-time access to
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>-specific information
and features from a host of your choice, if you configure your Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) and the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
security features to enable this access.</p>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> JMX features are
automatically available when
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is started in a JVM
that supports the platform MBean server. Java SE 5 and subsequent releases all
support JMX technology.</p>
<p>You start <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> by loading
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> embedded driver. If
you are using the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
Network Server, the embedded driver is automatically loaded in the server JVM
when the server is started.</p>
<p>You may access the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
MBeans by using an existing JMX client utility such as JConsole, or
programmatically by writing your own Java code that uses JMX.</p>
