<section>
<p>Use the derby.drda.startNetworkServer property to simplify
embedding the Network Server in your Java application. When you set 
derby.drda.startNetworkServer to true, the Network Server will automatically 
start when you start <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> 
(in this context, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
will start when the embedded driver is loaded). Only one Network Server
can be started in a JVM.</p>
<p>NOTE:
If you start the Network Server with this property set to true, the Network 
Server will stop when your application ends or when you stop it by other means 
(e.g. by using the Java API, the command line interface, or by shutting down 
the Derby system), whichever comes first.</p>
