<title>Accessing a read-only database in a zip/jar file</title>
<shortdesc>To access a database in a zip/jar, you specify the jar in the subsubprotocol.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:jar:(<i>pathToArchive</i>)<i>databasePathWithinArchive</i></codeblock>
<p>The <i>pathToArchive</i> is the absolute path to the archive file. The <i>databasePathWithinArchive</i> is
the relative path to the database within the archive. For example:</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:jar:(C:/dbs.jar)products/boiledfood
jdbc:derby:jar:(C:/dbs.jar)sales</codeblock>
<p>If you have trouble finding a database within an archive, check the contents
of the archive using your archive tool. The <i>databasePathWithinArchive</i> must
match the one in the archive. You might find that the path in the archive
has a leading slash, and thus the URL would be:</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:jar:(C:/dbs.jar)/products/boiledfood</codeblock>
<p>Databases in a jar or zip file are always opened read-only and there is
currently no support to allow updates of any type.</p>
