<title>Verifying system properties</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<p>You can find out the value of a system property if you set it
programmatically. You cannot find out the value of a system property if you set
it in the <i>derby.properties</i> file.</p>
<p>For example, if you set the value of the
<codeph>derby.storage.pageSize</codeph> system-wide property in your program or
on the command line, the following code will retrieve its value from the System
Properties object:
<codeblock><b>Properties sprops = System.getProperties();
System.out.println("derby.storage.pageSize value: "
+ sprops.getProperty("derby.storage.pageSize"));
</b></codeblock></p>
<p>You can also use Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology to obtain
system information, including some settings that correspond to system
properties. For details, see "Using Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology"
in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p>
