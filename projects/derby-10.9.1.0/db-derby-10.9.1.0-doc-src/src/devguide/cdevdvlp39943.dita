<p>The <i>derby.properties</i> file is not automatically created. If you want
to set <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties
with this file, you need to create the file yourself. The <i>derby.properties</i> file
should be in the format created by the <i>java.util.Properties.save</i> method.
For more information about properties and the <i>derby.properties</i> file,
see <xref href="cdevsetprop34818.dita#cdevsetprop34818"></xref> and the
