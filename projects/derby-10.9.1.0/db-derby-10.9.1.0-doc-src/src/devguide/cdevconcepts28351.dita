<title>Updatable result sets</title>
<shortdesc>
Updatable result sets in <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can be updated by
using result set update methods
(<codeph>updateRow()</codeph>,<codeph>deleteRow()</codeph> and
<codeph>insertRow()</codeph>), or by using positioned update or delete
queries.
</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<section>

<p> Both scrollable and non-scrollable result sets can be updatable in <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. 
</p>

<p> If the query which was executed to create the result set is not updatable, 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will downgrade
the concurrency mode to <codeph>ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY</codeph>,
and add a warning about this on the <codeph>ResultSet</codeph>. The
compilation of the query fails if the result set cannot be updatable,
and contains a <codeph>FOR UPDATE</codeph> clause. </p>

<p>Positioned updates and deletes can be performed if the query 
contains <codeph>FOR UPDATE</codeph> or if the concurrency mode for
the result set is <codeph>ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE</codeph>.</p>

<p>To use the result set update methods, the concurrency mode for the
result set must be <codeph>ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE</codeph>. 
The query does not need to contain <codeph>FOR UPDATE</codeph> to
use these methods. </p>

<p>Updatable cursors lock the current row with an update lock when
positioned on the row, regardless of isolation level. Therefore, to
avoid excessive locking of rows, only use concurrency mode
<codeph>ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE</codeph> or the <codeph>FOR
UPDATE</codeph> clause when you actually need to update the rows.

systems.</xref>
