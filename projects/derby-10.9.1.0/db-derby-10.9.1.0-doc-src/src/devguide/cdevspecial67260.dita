<title>Accessing before and after rows</title>
<shortdesc>Many trigger actions need to access the values of the rows being
changed.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Triggers<indexterm>accessing before and after rows</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Such trigger actions need to know one or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the "before" values of the rows being changed (their values before the
database event that caused the trigger to fire)</li>
<li>the "after" values of the rows being changed (the values to which the
database event is setting them)</li>
</ul>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides transition
variables and transition tables for a trigger action to access these values.
See "Referencing Old and New Values: The Referencing Clause" in the <cite><ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
