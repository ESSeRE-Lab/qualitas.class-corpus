<shortdesc>You can allow <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
authenticate users against an existing LDAP directory service within your
enterprise. LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol) provides an open
directory access protocol running over TCP/IP. An LDAP directory service can
quickly authenticate a user's name and password.</shortdesc>
