<title>Using Derby with IDEs</title>
<shortdesc>When you use an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop
an embedded <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> application,
you might need to run <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> within
a server framework.</shortdesc>

</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>This is because an IDE might try connecting to the database from two different
JVMs, whereas only a single JVM instance should connect to a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
at one time (multiple connections from the same JVM are allowed). </p>
<p>An "embedded <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> application"
is one which runs in the same JVM as the application. Such an application
uses the embedded <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> driver
(<i>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</i>) and connection URL (<codeph><i>jdbc:derby:databaseName</i></codeph>).
If you use this driver name or connection URL from the IDE, when the IDE tries
to open a second connection to the same database with the embedded <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
the attempt fails. Two JVMs cannot connect to the same database in embedded
mode.</p>
