<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides autoincrement
as a built-in feature; see CREATE TABLE statement in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
<p>Below is an example that shows how to use an identity column to create
the MAP_ID column of the MAPS table in the <i>toursDB database</i>.</p>
<codeblock>CREATE TABLE MAPS
(
MAP_ID INTEGER NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1),
MAP_NAME VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL,
REGION VARCHAR(26),
AREA DECIMAL(8,4) NOT NULL,
PHOTO_FORMAT VARCHAR(26) NOT NULL,
PICTURE BLOB(102400),
UNIQUE (MAP_ID, MAP_NAME)
)</codeblock>
