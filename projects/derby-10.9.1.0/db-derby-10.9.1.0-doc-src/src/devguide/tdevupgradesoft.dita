<title>Soft upgrade limitations</title>
<shortdesc>Soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> against
an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means
that you can continue to run an older version of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> against
the database.</shortdesc>

<taskbody>
<context> <p>If you perform a soft upgrade, you will not be able to perform
certain functions that are not available in older versions of
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. Specifically, new
features that affect the structure of a database are not available with a soft
upgrade. For a list of the new features in a release, see the Release Notes for
that release.</p></context>
<example>
<p>To perform a soft upgrade on a database created using an earlier version of
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, simply connect to the
database, as shown in the following example:</p>
<codeblock>connect 'jdbc:derby:sample'</codeblock>
</example>
