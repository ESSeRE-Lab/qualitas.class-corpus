<title>Deploying Derby in an embedded environment</title>
<shortdesc>You can embed <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
any Java application (single- or multi-user) by deploying the following packages.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<ul>
<li>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> library (<i>derby.jar</i>).</li>
<li>The libraries for the application. You have the option of storing these
libraries in the database.</li>
<li>The database or databases used by the application, in the context of their
system directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following figure, the top graphic shows the deployment of an application,
where the application, the Derby software for embedded use, the derby.properties
file and the database are four objects. The bottom graphic shows a simplified
deployment by reducing the number of objects to two by storing the application
and the properties file in the database. </p>

<image href="edeploy_os.gif" placement="break"><alt>This figure shows two graphics. The top graphic displays a slightly more complicated deployment of a Derby system involving four objects: the derby.jar file, your application jar file, the derby.properties file and the database. The bottom graphic displays a simplified deployment of a Derby system involving two objects. The application jar file and the derby properties are stored in the database. Only the derby.jar file is outside the database.</alt>
