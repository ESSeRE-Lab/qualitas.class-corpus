<conbody>
<p>A page is a unit of storage whose size is configurable on a system-wide,
database-wide, or conglomerate-specific basis. By default, a conglomerate
grows one page at a time until eight pages of user data (or nine pages of
total disk use, which includes one page of internal information) have been
allocated. (You can configure this behavior; see
"<i>derby.storage.initialPages</i>" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.) After that, it grows
eight pages at a time.</p>
<p>The size of a row or column is not limited by the page size. Rows or columns
that are longer than the table's page size are automatically wrapped to overflow
pages. </p>
