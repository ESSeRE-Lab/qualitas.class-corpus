<conbody>
<p>There is one important exception to the search order for properties described
above: When you set the <i>derby.database.propertiesOnly</i> property
to <i>true</i>, database-wide properties cannot be overridden
by system-wide properties.</p>
<p>This property ensures that a database's environment cannot be modified
by the environment in which it is booted. Any application running in an embedded
environment can set this property to <codeph>true</codeph> for security reasons.</p>
<p>See the "<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties"
section of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for details on the
<i>derby.database.propertiesOnly</i> property.</p>
