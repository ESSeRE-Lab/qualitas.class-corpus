<title>Double-booting system behavior</title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> prevents
two instances of itself from booting the same database by using a file called
<i>db.lck</i> inside the database directory.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>If a second instance of
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> attempts to boot an
already running database, the following error messages appear:</p>
<codeblock>
ERROR XJ040: Failed to start database 'firstdb', see the next exception
for details.
ERROR XSDB6: Another instance of Derby may have already booted the
database /home/myself/DERBYTUTOR/firstdb.
</codeblock>
<p>In addition, a stack trace appears in the <i>derby.log</i> file. For help
diagnosing a double boot problem, use the
<i>derby.stream.error.logBootTrace</i> property to obtain information about
both successful and unsuccessful boot attempts. The property is described in
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
<p>If you need to access a single database from more than one
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you will need to put a server solution in place. You
can allow applications from multiple JVMs that need to access that database to
connect to the server. The
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> Network Server is
provided as a server solution. For basic information on starting and using the
Network Server, see <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citgetstart"></ph>. See the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph> for more information on the
Network Server.</p>
