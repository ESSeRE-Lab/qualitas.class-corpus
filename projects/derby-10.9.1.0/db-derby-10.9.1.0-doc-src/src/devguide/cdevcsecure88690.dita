<title>Encrypting databases on creation</title>
<shortdesc>You configure a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
for encryption when you create the database by specifying the <i>dataEncryption=true</i> attribute
on the connection URL.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p> The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) determines the default encryption provider,
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For J2SE/J2EE 1.4 or higher, the JRE's provider is the default.</li>
<li>If your environment for some reason does not include a provider, it must be specified.</li> 
</ul>
<p>You have the option of specifying an alternate encryption provider. The
default encryption algorithm is DES, but you have the option of specifying
an alternate algorithm as well. See <xref href="cdevcsecure31493.dita#cdevcsecure31493"></xref></p>
