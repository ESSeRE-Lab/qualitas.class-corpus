<title>Accessing databases from the classpath</title>
<shortdesc>In most cases, you access databases from the file system. However,
it is also possible to access databases from the classpath. The databases
can be archived into a jar or zip file or left as is.</shortdesc>

<keywords><indexterm>Classpath<indexterm>accessing databases from</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>All such databases are read-only.</p>
<p>To access an unarchived database from the classpath, use the
<i>classpath</i> subsubprotocol.</p>
<p>For example, for a database called <i>sample</i> in
<i>C:\<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph>\demo\databases</i>,
you can put the
<i>C:\<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph>\demo\databases</i>
directory in the classpath and access <i>sample</i> like this:</p>
<codeblock>
jdbc:derby:classpath:sample
</codeblock>
<p>If only <i>C:\<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph></i>
were in the classpath, you could access <i>sample</i> (read-only) like this:</p>
<codeblock>
jdbc:derby:classpath:demo/databases/sample
</codeblock>
</conbody>
