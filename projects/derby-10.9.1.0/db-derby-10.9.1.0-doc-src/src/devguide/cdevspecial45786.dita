<title>User-defined SQLExceptions</title>
<shortdesc>When the execution of a database-side method raises an error, <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> wraps that exception
in an <i>SQLException</i> with an <codeph><i>SQLState</i></codeph> of 38000.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>SQLExceptions<indexterm>user-defined (38001-38999)</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>You can avoid having <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> wrap
the exception if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exception is an <i>SQLException</i></li>
<li>The range of the <i>SQLState</i> is 38001-38999</li>
</ul>
<p>(This conforms to the SQL99 standard.)</p>
