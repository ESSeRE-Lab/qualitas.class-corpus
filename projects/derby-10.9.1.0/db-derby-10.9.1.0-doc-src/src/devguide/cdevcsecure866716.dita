<title>Creating the boot password</title>
<shortdesc>When you encrypt a database you must also specify a boot password,
which is an alpha-numeric string used to generate the encryption key.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The length of the encryption key depends on the algorithm used:</p>
<ul>
<li>AES (128, 192, and 256 bits)</li>
<li>DES (the default) (56 bits)</li>
<li>DESede (168 bits)</li>
<li>All other algorithms (128 bits)</li>
</ul>
<note>The boot password should have at least as many characters as number
of bytes in the encryption key (56 bits=8 bytes, 168 bits=24 bytes, 128 bits=16
bytes). The minimum number of characters for the boot password allowed by <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is eight.</note>
<p>It is a good idea not to use words that would be easily guessed, such as
a login name or simple words or numbers. A <i>bootPassword</i>, like any password,
should be a mix of numbers and upper- and lowercase letters.</p>
<p>You turn on and configure encryption and specify the corresponding boot
password on the connection URL for a database when you create it:</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:encryptionDB1;create=true;dataEncryption=true;
    bootPassword=clo760uds2caPe</codeblock>
<note>If you lose the <i>bootPassword</i> and the database is not currently
booted, you will not be able to connect to the database anymore. (If you know
the current <i>bootPassword</i>, you can change it. See <xref href="tdevcsecurenewkeyoverview.dita"></xref>.)</note>
