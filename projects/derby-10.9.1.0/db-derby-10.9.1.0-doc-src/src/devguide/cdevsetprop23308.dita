<title>Precedence of properties</title>

<conbody>
<p>The search order for properties is:  
<ol>
<li>System-wide properties set programmatically (as a command-line option
to the JVM when starting the application or within application code)</li>
<li>Database-wide properties</li>
<li>System-wide properties set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file</li>
</ol></p>
<p>This means, for example, that system-wide properties set programmatically
override database-wide properties and system-wide properties set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file, and that database-wide properties
override system-wide properties set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file.</p>
