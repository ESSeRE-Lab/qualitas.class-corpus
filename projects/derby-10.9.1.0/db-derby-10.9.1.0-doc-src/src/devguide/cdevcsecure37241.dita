<title>Users and authorization identifiers</title>
<shortdesc>User names within the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
are known as <i>authorization identifiers</i>. The authorization identifier
is a string that represents the name of the user, if one was provided in the
connection request.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Authorization identifiers</indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>For example, the built-in function CURRENT_USER returns the authorization
identifier for the current user.</p>
<p>Once the authorization identifier is passed to the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system,
it becomes an <i>SQL92Identifier</i>. <codeph><i>SQL92Identifiers</i></codeph>-the
kind of identifiers that represent database objects such as tables and columns-are
case-insensitive (they are converted to all caps) unless delimited with double
quotes, are limited to 128 characters, and have other limitations.</p>
<p>User names must be valid authorization identifiers even if user authentication
is turned off, and even if all users are allowed access to all databases.</p>
<p>For more information about <i>SQL92Identifiers</i>, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
