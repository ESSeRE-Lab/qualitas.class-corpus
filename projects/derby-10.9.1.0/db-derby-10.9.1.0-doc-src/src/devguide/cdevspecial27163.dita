<title>Programming trigger actions</title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> allows
you to create triggers. When you create a trigger, you define an action or
set of actions that are executed when a database event occurs on a specified
table. A <i>database event</i> is a delete, insert, or update operation.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>For example, if you define a trigger for a delete on a particular table,
the trigger action is executed whenever someone deletes a row or rows from
the table.</p>
<p>The <codeph>CREATE TRIGGER</codeph> statement in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite> goes
into detail of the complete <codeph>CREATE TRIGGER</codeph> syntax. This section
provides information on defining the trigger action itself, which is only
one aspect of creating triggers.</p>
<p>This section refers to the <codeph>CREATE TRIGGER</codeph> statement as
the <i>trigger actions</i>.</p>
