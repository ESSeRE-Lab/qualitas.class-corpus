<p>In a client/server environment, you must set the system properties for
the <i>server</i>'s system. That means that when you are using
the <i>derby.properties</i> file, the file exists in the <i>server</i>'s
<i>derby.system.home</i> directory.
Client applications can set database-wide properties because they are set via
SQL statements.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the ways to set properties.</p>
<table frame="all">
