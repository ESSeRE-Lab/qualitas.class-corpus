<title>System-level properties</title>
<shortdesc>When you create users with system-level properties, those users
are available to all databases in the system.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>You set the value of this system-wide property once for each user, so you
can set it several times. To delete a user, remove that user from the file.</p>
<p>You can define this property in the usual ways -- typically in the <i>derby.properties</i> file.
For more information about setting properties, see 
<xref href="cdevsetprop34818.dita#cdevsetprop34818"></xref>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample excerpt from the <i>derby.properties</i> file:</p>
<codeblock><b># Users definition

derby.user.sa=<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph>pass
derby.user.mary=little7xylamb</codeblock>
