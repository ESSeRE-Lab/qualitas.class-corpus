<title>JNDI-specific properties for external directory services</title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> allows
you to set a few advanced JNDI properties, which you can set in any of the
supported ways of setting <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties.
Typically you would set these at the same level (database or system) for which
you configured the external authentication service.</shortdesc>

<p>The list of supported properties can be found in Appendix A: JNDI Standard
Environment Properties in the Java Naming and Directory API at 
<xref format="html" 
href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jndi/spec/jndi/properties.html"
scope="external">http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jndi/spec/jndi/properties.html</xref>.
The external directory service must support the property.</p>
<p>Each JNDI provider has its set of properties that you can set within the <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system.</p>
<p>For example, you can set the property <i>java.naming.security.authentication</i> to
allow user credentials to be encrypted on the network if the provider supports
it. You can also specify that SSL be used with LDAP (LDAPS).</p>
