<title>Transactions when auto-commit is disabled</title>
<shortdesc>When auto-commit is disabled, you use a <i>Connection</i> object's <codeph><i>commit</i></codeph> and <codeph><i>rollback</i></codeph> methods
to commit or roll back a transaction.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Auto-commit<indexterm>and  transactions</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The <codeph><i>commit</i></codeph> method makes permanent the changes resulting
from the transaction and releases locks. The <codeph><i>rollback</i></codeph> method
undoes all the changes resulting from the transaction and releases locks.
A transaction encompasses all the SQL statements executed against a single <codeph><i>Connection</i></codeph> object
since the last <codeph><i>commit</i></codeph> or <codeph><i>rollback</i></codeph>.</p>
<p>You do not need to explicitly begin a transaction. You implicitly end one
transaction and begin a new one after disabling auto-commit, changing the
isolation level, or after calling <codeph><i>commit</i></codeph> or <codeph><i>rollback</i></codeph>.</p>
<p>Committing a transaction also closes all <codeph><i>ResultSet</i></codeph> objects
excluding the <codeph><i>ResultSet</i></codeph> objects associated with cursors
with holdability <codeph>true</codeph>. The default holdability of the cursors
is <codeph>true</codeph> and <codeph><i>ResultSet</i></codeph> objects associated
with them need to be closed explicitly. A commit will not close such <codeph><i>ResultSet</i></codeph> objects.
It also releases any database locks currently held by the <codeph><i>Connection</i></codeph>,
whether or not these objects were created in different threads.</p>
