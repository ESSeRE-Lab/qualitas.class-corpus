<title>Deadlocks</title>
<shortdesc>In a database, a deadlock is a situation in which two or more transactions
are waiting for one another to give up locks.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>For example, Transaction A might hold a lock on some rows in the <i>Accounts</i> table
and needs to update some rows in the <i>Orders</i> table to finish. Transaction
B holds locks on those very rows in the <i>Orders</i> table but needs to update
the rows in the <i>Accounts</i> table held by Transaction A. Transaction A
cannot complete its transaction because of the lock on <i>Orders</i>. Transaction
B cannot complete its transaction because of the lock on <i>Accounts</i>.
All activity comes to a halt and remains at a standstill forever unless the
DBMS detects the deadlock and aborts one of the transactions. The following
figure shows this situation.</p>
