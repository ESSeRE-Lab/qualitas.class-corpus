<title>Notes on dynamic changes</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>When you are changing the <i>derby.database.classpath</i> property, all
classes loaded from database jar files are reloaded, even for a jar file that
has not changed.</p>
<p>Remember that the user's classpath is searched first.</p>
<p>Any existing prepared statements will use the previously loaded classes
unless they require class loading, in which case they will fail with a <i>ClassNotFound</i> error.</p>
<p>Cached objects do not match objects created with newly loaded classes.
For example, an in-memory <i>Customer</i> object will not match a new <i>Customer</i> object
if the <i>Customer</i> class has been reloaded, and it will
raise a <i>ClassCastException</i>.</p>
