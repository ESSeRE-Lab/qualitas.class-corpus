<title>Avoiding deadlocks</title>
<shortdesc>Using both row-level locking and the TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
isolation level makes it likely that you will avoid deadlocks (both settings
are <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> defaults). However,
deadlocks are still possible.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> application developers
can avoid deadlocks by using consistent application logic; for example, transactions
that access <i>Accounts</i> and <i>Orders</i> should always access the tables
in the same order. That way, in the scenario described above, Transaction
B simply waits for transaction A to release the lock on <i>Orders</i> before
it begins. When transaction A releases the lock on <i>Orders</i>, Transaction
B can proceed freely.</p>
<p>Another tool available to you is the LOCK TABLE statement. A transaction
can attempt to lock a table in exclusive mode when it starts to prevent other
transactions from getting shared locks on a table. For more information, see
"LOCK TABLE statement" in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
