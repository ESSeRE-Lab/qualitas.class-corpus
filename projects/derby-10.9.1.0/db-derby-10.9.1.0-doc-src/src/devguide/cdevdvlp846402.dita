<title>Connecting to databases outside the system directory</title>
<shortdesc>You can also connect to databases in other directories (including
subdirectories of the system directory) by specifying a relative or absolute
path name to identify the database. The way you specify an absolute path is
defined by the host operating system.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>Using the connection URL as described here, you can connect to databases
in more than one directory at a time.</p>
<p>Two examples:</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:../otherDirectory/myDB

jdbc:<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph>:c:/otherDirectory/myDB</codeblock>
<note>Once connected, such a database becomes a part of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system,
even though it is not in the system directory. This means that it takes on
the system-wide properties of the system and no other instance of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> should
access that database. It is recommended that you connect to databases only
in the system directory.</note>
</conbody>
