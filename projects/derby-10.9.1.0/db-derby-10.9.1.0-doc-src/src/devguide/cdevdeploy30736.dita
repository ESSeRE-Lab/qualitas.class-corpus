<conbody>
<p>Application logic, which can be used by SQL functions and procedures, includes
Java class files and other resources. Storing application code simplifies
application deployment, since it reduces the potential for problems with a
user's classpath.</p>
<p>In an embedded environment, when application logic is stored in the database, <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can access classes loaded
by the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> class loader
from stored jar files. </p>
</conbody>
