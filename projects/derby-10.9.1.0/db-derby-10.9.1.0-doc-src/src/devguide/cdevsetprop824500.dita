<title>Persistence of properties</title>

<conbody>
<p>A database-wide property always has persistence. That is, its value is
stored in the database. Typically, it is in effect until you explicitly change
the property or until you set a system-wide property with precedence over
database-wide properties (see <xref href="cdevsetprop23308.dita#cdevsetprop23308"/>).</p>
<p>To disable or turn off a database-wide property setting, set its value to
null. This has the effect of removing the property from the list of database
properties and restoring the system property setting, if there is one (and if
<i>derby.database.propertiesOnly</i> has not been set; see
<xref href="cdevsetprop824533.dita#cdevsetprop824533"></xref>).</p>
<p>A system-wide property might have persistence, depending on how you set
it. If you set it programmatically, it persists only for the duration of the
JVM of the application that set it. If you set it in the
<i>derby.properties</i> file, a property persists until:</p>  
<ul>
<li>That value is changed and the system is rebooted</li>
<li>The file is removed from the system and the system is rebooted</li>
<li>The database is booted outside of that system</li>
</ul>
