<title>The error log</title>
<shortdesc>Once you create or connect to a database within a system, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> begins
outputting information and error messages to the error log. Typically,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> writes this information
to a file called <i>derby.log</i> in the system directory.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Error log<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Alternatively, you can have <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> send
messages to a stream, using the <i>derby.stream.error.method</i> or
<i>derby.stream.error.field</i> property, or to a different file, using the
<i>derby.stream.error.file</i> property. If you use any of these
properties, the property setting will appear in the log.</p>
<p>
By default, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> overwrites <i>derby.log</i> when
you start the system. You can configure <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
append to the log with the <i>derby.infolog.append</i> property.</p>
<p>For information on setting all of these properties, see the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
