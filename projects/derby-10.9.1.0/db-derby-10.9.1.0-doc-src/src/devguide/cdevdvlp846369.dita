<title>Connecting to databases within the system</title>
<shortdesc>The standard way to access databases in the file system is by specifying
the path to the database, either absolute or relative to the system directory.
In a client/server environment, this path is always on the <i>server</i> machine.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>By default, you can connect to databases within the current system directory
(see <xref href="cdevdvlp13018.dita#cdevdvlp13018"></xref>). To connect to
databases within the current system, just specify the database name on the
connection URL. For example, if your system directory contains a database
called <i>myDB</i>, you can connect to that database with the following connection
URL:</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:myDB</codeblock>
<p>The full call within a Java program would be:</p>
<codeblock>Connection conn =DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:myDB");</codeblock>
</conbody>
