at a time, and only one application can access a specific system at a time.
When using a pre-1.4 JVM, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> might
not prevent multiple applications from concurrently accessing the same <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system, but do not allow
this because such access can corrupt the databases involved.</entry>

remote client applications can access the same server, and thus can access
the same database at the same time through that server.</entry>
