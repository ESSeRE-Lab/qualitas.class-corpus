<title>Accessing databases from a jar or zip file</title>
<shortdesc>It is possible to access databases from a jar file. The jar file
does not have to be on the classpath.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<note>All such databases are read-only.</note>
<p>For example, suppose you have archived the database <i>jarDB1</i> into
a file called <i>jar1.jar</i>. This archive is in the classpath before you
start up <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. You can
access <i>jarDB1</i> with the following connection URL</p>
<codeblock>jdbc:derby:classpath:jarDB1</codeblock>
<p>To access a database in a jar file that is not on the classpath, use the
<i>jar</i> subprotocol. </p>
<p>For example, suppose you have archived the database <i>jarDB2</i> into
a file called <i>jar2.jar</i>. This archive is not in the classpath. You can
access <i>jarDB2</i> by specifying the path to the jar file along with the
<i>jar</i> subsubprotocol, like this:</p>
<codeblock>
jdbc:derby:jar:(c:/<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productlowercase"></ph>/lib/jar2.jar)jarDB2
</codeblock>
<p>For complete instructions and examples of accessing databases in jar files,
see <xref href="cdevdeploy11201.dita#cdevdeploy11201"></xref>.</p>
