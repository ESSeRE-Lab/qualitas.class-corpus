<prereq>Ensure that you <xref href="tdevpreupgrade.dita">complete the prerequisite
steps</xref> before you upgrade:<ul>
<li>Back up your database before you upgrade.</li>
<li>Ensure that only the new <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> jar
files are in your CLASSPATH.</li>
</ul></prereq>
<context> <p>When you upgrade the database, you can perform a full upgrade
or soft upgrade:<ul>
<li>A full upgrade is a complete upgrade of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database.
When you perform a full upgrade, you cannot connect to the database with an
older version of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and
you cannot revert back to the previous version. </li>
<li>A soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> against
an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means
that you can continue to run an older version of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> against
the database. However, if you perform a soft upgrade, certain features will
not be available to you until you perform a full upgrade.</li>
</ul></p></context>
