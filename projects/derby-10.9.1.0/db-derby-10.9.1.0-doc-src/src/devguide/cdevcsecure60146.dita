<title>Booting an encrypted database</title>
<shortdesc>If you create an encrypted database using the <i>bootPassword</i> attribute,
you must specify the boot password to reboot the database. If you create an
encrypted database using the <i>encryptionKey</i> attribute, you must specify
the <i>encryptionKey</i> to reboot the database.</shortdesc>

<p>Encrypted databases cannot be booted automatically along with all other
system databases on system startup (see "<i>derby.system.bootAll</i>" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>). Instead, you boot encrypted
databases when you first connect to the database.</p>

<dt>Booting a database with the <i>bootPassword</i> attribute</dt>
<dd>To access an encrypted database called <codeph>wombat</codeph> that was
created with the boot password <codeph>clo760uds2caPe</codeph>, use the following
connection URL:<codeblock>jdbc:derby:wombat;bootPassword=clo760uds2caPe</codeblock></dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>Booting a database with the <i>encryptionKey</i> attribute</dt>
<dd>To access an encrypted database called <codeph>flintstone</codeph> that
was created with the <codeph>encryptionKey=c566bab9ee8b62a5ddb4d9229224c678</codeph> and
with the <codeph>encryptionAlgorithm=AES/CBC/NoPadding</codeph>, use the following
connection URL:   <codeblock>jdbc:derby:flintstone;encryptionAlgorithm=AES/CBC/NoPadding;
encryptionKey=c566bab9ee8b62a5ddb4d9229224c678  </codeblock></dd>
</dlentry></dl></p>
<p>After the database is booted, all connections can access the database without
the boot password. Only a connection that boots the database requires the
key.</p>
<p>For example, the following connections would boot the database and require
the boot password or encryption key, depending on what mechanism was used
to encrypt the database originally:<ul>
<li>The first connection to the database in the JVM session</li>
<li>The first connection to the database after the database has been explicitly
shut down</li>
<li>The first connection to the database after the system has been shut down
and then rebooted</li>
</ul></p>
<note>The boot password and the encryption key are not meant to prevent unauthorized
connections to the database after the database is booted. To protect a database
after it has been booted, turn on user authentication (see <xref href="cdevcsecure42374.dita#cdevcsecure42374"></xref>).</note>
