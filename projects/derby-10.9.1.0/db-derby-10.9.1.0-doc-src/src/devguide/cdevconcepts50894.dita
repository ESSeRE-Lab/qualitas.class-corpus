<title>Debugging Deadlocks</title>
<shortdesc>If deadlocks occur frequently in your multi-user system with a
particular application, you might need to do some debugging.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides a class
    to help you in this situation, <i>org.apache.derby.diag.LockTable</i>.
    Access to the <i>LockTable</i> information is provided via the
    SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table.</p>
<p>The SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE
diagnostic table shows all of the locks that are currently held in the <ph
    conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database. 
You can reference the SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table directly
in a statement.</p>
<p>For
    example:<codeblock>SELECT * FROM SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE</codeblock></p>
<p>When
the SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table is referenced in a statement, a
snapshot of the lock table is taken.
</p><p>
    For more information about how to use this table:
    <ul>
        <li>See "SYSCS_DIAG diagnostic tables and functions" in the
            <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</li>
        <li>See the <xref format="html"
            href="http://db.apache.org/derby/javadoc/engine/org/apache/derby/diag/LockTable.html" scope="external">LockTable API documentation</xref>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    You
can also set the property <i>derby.locks.deadlockTrace</i> to dump additional
information to the derby.log file about any deadlocks that occur on your system. 
See the Tuning Guide for more information on this property. For information, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph></cite>.</p>
