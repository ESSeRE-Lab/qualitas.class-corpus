<conbody>
<p>For example, suppose that user <codeph>anita</codeph> wants to create a view
using the following statement:</p>
<codeblock>CREATE VIEW s.v(vc1,vc2,vc3)
	AS SELECT t1.c1,t1.c2,f(t1.c3)
  FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 
	WHERE t2.c2 = 5</codeblock>
<p>User <codeph>anita</codeph> needs the following privileges to create the
view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ownership of the schema <codeph>s</codeph>, so that she can create something
in the schema</li>
<li>Ownership of the table <codeph>t1</codeph>, so that she can allow others
to see columns in the table</li>
<li>SELECT privilege on column <codeph>t2.c1</codeph> and column
<codeph>t2.c2</codeph></li>
<li>EXECUTE privilege on function <codeph>f</codeph></li>
</ul>
<p>When the view is created, only user <codeph>anita</codeph> has the SELECT
privilege on it. User <codeph>anita</codeph> can grant the SELECT privilege on
any or all of the columns of view <codeph>s.v</codeph> to anyone, even to users
that do not have the SELECT privilege on <codeph>t1</codeph> or
<codeph>t2</codeph>, or the EXECUTE privilege on <codeph>f</codeph>. User
<codeph>anita</codeph> then grants the SELECT privilege on view
<codeph>s.v</codeph> to user <codeph>harry</codeph>. When user
<codeph>harry</codeph> issues a SELECT statement on the view
<codeph>s.v</codeph>, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
checks to determine if user <codeph>harry</codeph> has the SELECT privilege on
view <codeph>s.v</codeph>.
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does not check to
determine if user <codeph>harry</codeph> has the SELECT privilege on
<codeph>t1</codeph> or <codeph>t2</codeph>, or the EXECUTE privilege on
<codeph>f</codeph>.</p>
<p>Privileges on triggers and constraints work the same way as privileges on
views. When a view, trigger, or constraint is created,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> checks that the owner
has the required privileges. Other users do not need to have those privileges
to perform actions on a view, trigger, or constraint.</p>
<p>If the required privileges are revoked from the owner of a view, trigger,
or constraint, the object is dropped as part of the REVOKE statement.</p>
<p>Another way of saying that privileges on objects belong to the owner is to
call them <term>definer rights</term>, as opposed to <term>invoker rights</term>.
This is the terminology used by the SQL standard.</p>
