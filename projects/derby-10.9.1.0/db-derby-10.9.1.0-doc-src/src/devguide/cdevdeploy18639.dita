<title>Embedded systems and properties</title>
<shortdesc>Database-wide properties are stored in the database and are simpler
for deployment, while system-wide parameters might be easier for development.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<ul>
<li>If you are setting any system-wide properties, see if they can be set
as database-wide properties instead.</li>
<li>Are any properties being set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file? Some
properties can only be set on a system-wide basis. If so, deploy the entire
system directory along with the properties file. Deploy only those databases
that you wish to include. Setting properties programmatically can simplify
this step- you will not have to worry about deploying the system directory/properties
file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra steps are required for deploying an application and an embedded database
on read-only media.</p>
