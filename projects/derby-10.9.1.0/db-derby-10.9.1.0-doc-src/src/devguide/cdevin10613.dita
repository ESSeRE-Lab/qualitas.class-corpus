<conbody>
<p>The word <i>locale</i> in the Java platform refers to an instance of a
class that identifies a particular combination of language and region. If
a Java class varies its behavior according to <i>locale</i>, it is said to
be locale-sensitive. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides
some support for locales for databases and other components such as the tools
and the installer.</p>
<p>It also provides a feature to support databases in many different languages,
a feature which is independent of a particular territory.</p>
<p>When you create or upgrade a database, you can use the territory attribute
to associate a non-default territory with the database. For information about
how to use the territory attribute, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
