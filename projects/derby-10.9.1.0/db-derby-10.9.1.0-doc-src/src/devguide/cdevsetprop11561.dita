<conbody>
<p>You can set properties programmatically -- either in application code before
booting the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> driver or
as a command-line option to the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) when booting the application that starts up
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. When you set
properties programmatically, these properties persist only for the duration of
the application. Properties set programmatically are not written to the
<i>derby.properties</i> file or made persistent in any other way by
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
<note>Setting properties programmatically works only for the application that
starts up <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>; for example,
for an application in an embedded environment or for the application server that
starts up a server product. It does not work for client applications connecting
to a server that is running.</note>
<p>You can set properties programmatically in the following ways:</p>

</ul>
<section id="comparam"><title>As a parameter to the JVM command line</title>
<p>You can set system-wide properties as parameters to the JVM command line when
you start up the application or framework in which
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is embedded. To do so,
you typically use the <i>-D</i> option. For example:</p>
<codeblock><b>java -Dderby.system.home=C:\home\<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>\ 
    -Dderby.storage.pageSize=8192 JDBCTest</b></codeblock>
</section>
<section id="propobj">
<title>Using a Properties object within an application or statement</title>
<p>In embedded mode, your application runs in the same JVM as
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, so you can also set
system properties within an application using a <i>Properties</i> object before
loading the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> JDBC
driver. The following example sets <i>derby.system.home</i> on Windows.</p>
<codeblock><b>Properties p = System.getProperties();
p.setProperty("derby.system.home", "C:\databases\sample");</b></codeblock>
<note>If you pass in a <i>Properties</i> object as an argument to the
<i>DriverManager.getConnection</i> call when connecting to a database, those
properties are used as database connection URL attributes, not as properties of
the type discussed in this section. For more information, see
<xref href="cdevdvlp34964.dita#cdevdvlp34964"></xref> and
<xref href="cdevdvlp51654.dita#cdevdvlp51654"></xref> as well as the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</note>
