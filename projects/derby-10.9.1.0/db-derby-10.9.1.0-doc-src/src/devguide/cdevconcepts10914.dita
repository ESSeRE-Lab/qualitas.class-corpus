<conbody>
<p>If more than one client application tries to modify the same data, the
connection that gets the table first gets the lock on the data (either specific
rows or the entire table). The second connection has to wait until the first
connection commits or rolls back the transaction in order to access the data.
If two connections are only querying and not modifying data, they can both
access the same data at the same time because they can each get a shared lock.</p>
