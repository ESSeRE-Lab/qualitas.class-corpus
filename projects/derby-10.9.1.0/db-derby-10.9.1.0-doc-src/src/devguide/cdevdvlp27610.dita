<conbody>
<p>A <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system is a
single instance of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database
engine and the environment in which it runs. It consists of a system directory,
zero or more databases, and a system-wide configuration. The system directory
contains any persistent system-wide configuration parameters, or properties,
specific to that system in a properties file called <xref href="cdevdvlp39943.dita#cdevdvlp39943">derby.properties</xref>.
This file is not automatically created; you must create it yourself.</p>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system is
not persistent; you must specify the location of the system directory at every
startup.</p>
<p>However, the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
and the system directory is an essential part of a running database or databases.
Understanding the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
is essential to successful development and deployment of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> applications.
As the following figure shows,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases live in a
system, which includes system-wide properties, an error log, and one or more
databases.</p>
<fig expanse="column" id="rdevdvlp17155"><title>Derby system</title>
<image href="system_os.gif" placement="break"><alt>This figure shows a Derby system that includes a database called Accounting and a database called Sales. The figure shows the derby.system.home system variable pointing to the databases and explains that this system variable tells Derby the name of your system directory. Additionally, this figure shows that the derby.properties file and the derby.log file are part of the Derby system.</alt>
</image>
</fig>
<p>The system directory can also contain an error log file called <i>derby.log </i>(see <xref
href="cdevdvlp25889.dita#cdevdvlp25889"></xref>).</p>
<p>Each database within that system is contained in a subdirectory, which
has the same name as the database (see <xref href="cdevdvlp21955.dita#cdevdvlp21955"></xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, if you connect to a database outside the current system, it
automatically becomes part of the current system.</p>
<p>When you use the embedded driver,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database files and log
files normally have whatever default permissions you specify for your file
system. If you are running with Java SE 7 or later, however, you can enhance
security by restricting file access to the user who creates the database. To do
this, set the system property <i>derby.storage.useDefaultFilePermissions</i> to
false. See the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for details.</p>
<p><note>In-memory databases do not appear in the system directory.</note></p>
