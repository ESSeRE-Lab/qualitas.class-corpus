<title>Shutting down Derby or an individual database</title>
<shortdesc>Applications in an embedded environment shut down the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
by specifying the <i>shutdown=true</i> attribute in the connection URL. To
shut down the system, you do not specify a database name, and you do not
ordinarily specify any other attribute.</shortdesc>

<context> <codeblock>jdbc:derby:;<ph>shutdown=true</ph></codeblock><p>A successful
shutdown always results in an <i>SQLException</i> to indicate that <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> has
shut down and that there is no other exception.</p>
<p>If you have enabled user authentication at the system level, you will need to
specify credentials (that is, username and password) in order to shut down a
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system, and the
supplied username and password must also be defined at the system level.</p>
<note type="important"><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s
BUILTIN authentication mechanism is suitable only for development and testing
purposes, and it will no longer be documented in future releases. It is strongly
recommended that production systems rely on NATIVE authentication, an
external directory service such as LDAP, or a user-defined class for
authentication. It is also strongly recommended that production systems protect
network connections with SSL/TLS.</note>
<p>You can also shut down
an individual database if you specify the <i>databaseName</i>. You can shut
down the database of the current connection if you specify the default connection
instead of a database name<i> </i>(within an SQL statement).</p><codeblock><b>// shutting down a database from your application</b>
DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:sample;shutdown=true");</codeblock>

If user

and
<xref href="cdevcsecure36595.dita#cdevcsecure36595">SQL authorization</xref>
are both enabled, only the
<xref href="cdevcsecureDbOwner.dita#cdevcsecureDbOwner">database owner</xref>
can shut down the database.

<p>
<note type="attention"> 
It is good practice to close existing connections before shutting down 
the system or database. Connections created before the shutdown will not 
be usable after shutdown is performed.  Attempting to access  connections 
after shutdown may cause errors including instances of 
<codeph>NullPointerException</codeph> or protocol violations.
