<title>One Derby instance for each Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</title>
<shortdesc>You could potentially have two instances of a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
running on the same machine at the same time. Each instance must run
in a different Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>If you use the embedded driver, two
separate instances of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
cannot access the same database. If
a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> instance attempts 
to access a running database, an error message appears, and a stack trace
appears in the <i>derby.log</i> file. If you want more than one
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> instance to be able
to access the same database, you can use the Network Server.</p>
<p>If a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> instance
uses the in-memory database capability for its database connection, the database
exists only within the JVM of that
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> instance. Another
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> instance could refer to
the same database name, but it would not be referring to the same actual
database, and no error would result.</p>
