<title>Programming database-side JDBC routines</title>
<shortdesc>Methods invoked within an application are called application-side
methods. Methods invoked within <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> are
called database-side routines.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>An application-side method can be exactly the same as a database-side routine.
The only difference is where you invoke them. You write the method only once.
Where you invoke the method--within the application or within an SQL statement--determines
whether it is an "application-side" or a "database-side" method. </p>
