<title>Defining the system directory</title>
<shortdesc>You define the system directory when <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> starts
up by specifying a Java <i>system property</i> called <i>derby.system.home</i>.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>If you do not specify the system directory when starting up <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
the current directory becomes the system directory.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> uses the <i>derby.system.home</i> property
to determine which directory is its system directory - and thus what databases
are in its system, where to create new databases, and what configuration parameters
to use. See the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for
more information on this property.</p>
<p>If you specify a system directory at startup that does not exist, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> creates
this new directory - and thus a new system with no databases-automatically.</p>
</conbody>
