<section id="authupgradehowto"><title>Upgrading Authentication and Authorization</title>

<p>To protect a single-user database and convert it to a shared,
multi-user database, simply enable authentication and SQL
authorization. To do this, first turn on user authentication as
described in the section on
<xref href="cdevcsecure42374.dita#cdevcsecure42374">Working with user authentication</xref>.
Make sure that you supply login credentials for the database owner. In
most single-user databases, the database owner is APP. However, the
database owner could be some other user if the original database
creation URL specified a user name--see the section on
<xref href="cdevcsecureDbOwner.dita#cdevcsecureDbOwner">Database owner</xref>.
If you are unsure about who owns the database, run the following query:
</p>
<codeblock>select authorizationid from sys.sysschemas where schemaname = 'SYS'</codeblock>
<p>
After enabling user authentication, turn on SQL authorization. To do
this, connect to the database as the database owner and issue the
following command:
</p>
<codeblock>call syscs_util.syscs_set_database_property( 'derby.database.sqlAuthorization', 'true' )</codeblock>
<p>
Now shutdown the database to activate the new value of
<codeph>derby.database.sqlAuthorization</codeph>. The next time you
boot the database, it will be protected by authentication and SQL authorization.
</p>

<section id="authupgradebehavior"><title>Behavior of Upgraded Databases</title>

<p>
You will notice the following behavior changes in your upgraded database:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Data</b> - Users can access data in their own schemas. However,
users cannot access data in schemas owned by other users. In
particular, other users cannot access data in schemas belonging to the
database owner. The database owner may need to GRANT access to that data.</li>
<li><b>Database Maintenance</b> - In a single-user database, anyone
can run maintenance procedures to backup/restore and import/export
data. In the upgraded, multi-user database,
only the database owner can perform these sensitive operations.</li>
</ul>
