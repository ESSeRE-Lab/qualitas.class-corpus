<title>Setting up <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
use your LDAP directory service</title>
<shortdesc>When specifying LDAP as your authentication service, you must specify
what LDAP server to use.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<ul>
<li><p>Set the property <i>derby.authentication.server</i> to
the URL to the LDAP server. For example:</p> 
<codeblock>derby.authentication.server=ldap://godfrey:389/</codeblock>
<p>The LDAP server may be specified using just the server name, the server name
and its port number separated by a colon, or an "ldap" URL. If a full URL is not
provided, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will by
default use unencrypted LDAP. To use SSL encrypted LDAP, a URL starting with
"ldaps://" must be provided. For details on the
<i>derby.authentication.server</i> property, see the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
</li> 
<li><p>Grant <i>java.net.SocketPermission</i> to <codeph>derby.jar</codeph>, so
that the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> code is
allowed to contact the LDAP server to perform the authentication. See 
<xref href="cdevbabejgjd.dita#cdevbabejgjd"></xref> for more information.</p>
