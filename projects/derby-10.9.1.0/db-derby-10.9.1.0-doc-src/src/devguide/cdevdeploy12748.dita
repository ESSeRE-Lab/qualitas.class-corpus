<title>Code your applications</title>
<shortdesc>In your applications, you load the classes either by indirectly
referencing them in the code or by directly using <i>java.lang.Class.forName</i>.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>You load resources the way you normally would, using the standard <i>java.lang.Class.getResourceAsStream</i>,
a mechanism that allows an application to access resources defined in the
classpath without knowing where or how they are stored.</p>
<p>You do not need to make any changes to the way code interacts with <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and its JDBC driver.
An application can safely attempt to boot <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
even though it is already running, without any errors. Applications connect
to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in the usual manner.</p>
<note>The method <i>getResource</i> is not supported.</note>
