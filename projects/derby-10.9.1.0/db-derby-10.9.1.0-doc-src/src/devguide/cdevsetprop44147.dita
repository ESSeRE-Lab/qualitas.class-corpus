<title>Making dynamic or static changes to properties</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<conbody>
<note>Properties set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file and on the command line of the application that boots <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> are <i>always</i> static, because <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> reads this file and
those parameters only at startup.</note>
<p>Only properties set in the following ways have the potential to be dynamic:
 
<ul>
<li>As database-wide properties</li>
<li>As system-wide properties via a <i>Properties</i> object
in the application in which the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> engine is embedded</li>
</ul></p>
<p>See the "<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties"
section of the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for information
about specific properties.</p>
