<title>Requirements for database-side JDBC routines using nested connections</title>
<shortdesc>In order to preserve transactional atomicity, database-side JDBC
routines that use nested connections have the following limitations.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p> <ul>
<li>Can issue a commit or rollback only within a procedure (not a function).
  </li>
<li>Cannot change the auto-commit connection attribute.</li>
<li>Cannot modify the data in a table used by the parent statement that called
the routine, using INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. For example, if a SELECT statement
using the <i>T</i> table calls the <codeph><i>changeTables</i></codeph> procedure, <codeph><i>changeTables</i></codeph> cannot
modify data in the <i>T</i> table. </li>
<li>Cannot drop a table used by the statement that called the routine.</li>
<li>Cannot be in a class whose static initializer executes DDL statements.</li>
</ul>In addition, the Connection object that represents the nested connection
always has its auto-commit mode set to false.</p>
