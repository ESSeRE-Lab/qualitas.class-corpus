<title>Working with the database connection URL attributes</title>
<shortdesc>You specify attributes on the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> connection
URL.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>The examples in this section use the syntax of the connection URL for use
in an embedded environment. You can also specify these same attributes and
values on the client connection URL if you are using <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> as
a database server. For more information, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph></cite>.</p>
<p>You can also set these attributes by passing a <i>Properties</i> object
along with a connection URL to <codeph><i>DriverManager.getConnection</i></codeph> when
obtaining a connection; see <xref href="tdevdvlp36289.dita#tdevdvlp36289"></xref>.
If you specify any attributes both on the connection URL and in a
<i>Properties</i> object, the attributes on the connection URL override the
attributes in the <i>Properties</i> object.</p>
<p>All attributes are optional. </p>
<p>For complete information about the attributes, see "Setting attributes for
the database connection URL" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
<p>For detailed information about the connection URL syntax,
see <xref href="cdevdvlp17453.dita#cdevdvlp17453"></xref>.</p>
