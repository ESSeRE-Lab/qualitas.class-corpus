<title>Derby JDBC driver</title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> consists
of both the database engine and an embedded JDBC driver. Applications use
JDBC to interact with a database. Applications running on JDK 5 or earlier
must load the driver in order to work with the database.</shortdesc>

</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>In an embedded environment, loading the driver also starts <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
<p>The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> driver
class name for the embedded environment is <i>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</i>.</p>
<p>In a Java application, you typically load the driver with the static <i>Class.forName</i> method
or with the <i>jdbc.drivers</i> system property. For example:</p>
<codeblock>
Class.forName("org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver");
</codeblock>
<codeblock>java -Djdbc.drivers=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver<i> applicationClass</i>
</codeblock>
<p>For detailed information about loading the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> JDBC
driver, see "java.sql.Driver interface" in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite>.</p>
<p>If your application runs on JDK 6 or higher, you do not need to
explicitly load the <codeph>EmbeddedDriver</codeph>. In that environment, the
driver loads automatically.</p>
<p>If your application shuts down Derby or calls the
<i>DriverManager.deregisterDriver</i>
method, and you then want to reload the driver, call the
<i>Class.forName().newInstance()</i> method.</p>
