<conbody>
<p>For example:</p>
<codeblock>CREATE TRIGGER . . .
DELETE FROM flightavailability 
	WHERE flight_id IN (SELECT flight_id FROM flightavailability 
		WHERE YEAR(flight_date) &lt; 2005);) </codeblock>
<p>A trigger action does have some limitations, though; for example, it cannot
contain dynamic parameters or alter the table on which the trigger is defined.
See "TriggerAction" in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite> for
details. </p>
