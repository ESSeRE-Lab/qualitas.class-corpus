<li>Separately as arguments to the following signature of the method: <i>getConnection(String
url, String user, String password)</i>   <codeblock>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:myDB", "mary", "little7xylamb");</codeblock></li>
<li>As attributes to the database connection URL   <codeblock>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:myDB;user=mary;password=little7xylamb");</codeblock></li>
<li>By setting the user and password properties in a Properties object as
with other connection URL attributes   <codeblock>Properties p = new Properties();
p.put("user", "mary");
p.put("password", "little7xylamb");
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(

<section> <note>The password is not encrypted. When you are using <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
the context of a server framework, the framework should be responsible for
encrypting the password across the network. If your framework does not encrypt
the password, it is strongly recommended that you protect network connections
with SSL/TLS.</note></section>
