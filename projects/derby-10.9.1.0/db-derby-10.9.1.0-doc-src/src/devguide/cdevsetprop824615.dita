<conbody>
<p>Most properties are dynamic; that means you can set them while <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is
running, and their values change without requiring a reboot of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.
In some cases, this change takes place immediately; in some cases, it takes
place at the next connection.</p>
<p>Some properties are static, which means changes to their values will not
take effect while <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is running. You must restart or set them before
(or while) starting <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
<p>For more information, see <xref href="cdevsetprop44147.dita#cdevsetprop44147"/>.</p>
