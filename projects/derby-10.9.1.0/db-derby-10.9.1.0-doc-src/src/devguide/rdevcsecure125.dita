<title>Setting LDAP user authentication properties in a client/server environment</title>
<shortdesc>In this example, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is
running in a user-designed application server.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<refbody>
<section><p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides
the user authentication, not the application server. The server is running
in a secure environment, the application server encrypts the passwords, and
a database administrator is available. The administrator configures security
using system-level properties in the <i>derby.properties</i> file and has
protected this file with operating system tools. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> connects
to an existing LDAP directory service within the enterprise to authenticate
users.</p></section>
<section><p>The default access mode for all databases is set to <i>fullAccess</i> (the
default).</p></section>
<section><p>The <i>derby.properties</i> file for the server includes the following
entries:</p></section>
<example> <codeblock><b># turn on user authentication</b>
derby.connection.requireAuthentication=true
<b># set the authentication provider to an external LDAP server</b>
derby.authentication.provider=LDAP
<b># the host name and port number of the LDAP server</b>
derby.authentication.server=godfrey:389
<b># the search base for user names</b>
derby.authentication.ldap.searchBase=o=oakland.example.com
<b># explicitly show the access mode for databases (this is default)</b>
derby.database.defaultConnectionMode=fullAccess</codeblock></example>
<section><p>With these settings, all users must be authenticated by the LDAP
server in order to access any <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases.</p></section>
<section><p>The database administrator has determined that one database, <i>accountingDB</i>,
has additional security needs. Within a connection to that database, the database
administrator uses database-wide properties (which override properties set
in the <i>derby.properties</i> file) to limit access to this database. Only
the users <i>prez</i>, <i>cfo</i>, and <i>numberCruncher</i> have full (read-write)
access to this database, and only <i>clerk1</i> and <i>clerk2</i> have read-only
access to this database. No other users can access the database.</p></section>
<example> <codeblock><b>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY(
    'derby.database.defaultConnectionMode', 'noAccess')

CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY(
    'derby.database.fullAccessUsers',
    'prez,cfo,numberCruncher')

CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY(
    'derby.database.readOnlyAccessUsers', 'clerk1,clerk2')</b></codeblock></example>
<section><p>The database administrator then requires all current users to
disconnect and re-connect. These property changes do not go into effect for
current connections. The database administrator can force current users to
reconnect by shutting down the database</p></section>
