<title>Recommended practices</title>
<shortdesc>When developing <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> applications,
create a single directory to hold your database or databases.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>System directory<indexterm>creating and naming directory
for</indexterm></indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Give this directory a unique name, to help you remember that: <ul>
<li>All databases exist within a system.</li>
<li>System-wide properties affect the entire system, and persistent system-wide
properties live in the system directory.</li>
<li>You can boot all the databases in the system, and the boot-up times of
all databases affect the performance of the system.</li>
<li>You can preboot databases only if they are within the system. (Databases
do not necessarily have to live inside the system <i>directory</i>, but keeping
your databases there is the recommended practice.)</li>
<li>Once you connect to a database, it is part of the current system and thus
inherits all system-wide properties.</li>
<li>Only one instance of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can
run in a JVM at a single time.</li>
<li>The error log is located inside the system directory.</li>
</ul></p>
