<title>Creating, dropping, and backing up databases</title>
<shortdesc>You create new databases and access existing ones by specifying
attributes to the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> connection
URL.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>If you use an in-memory database, you can use a connection URL attribute
to drop it. For a file system database, however, there is no drop attribute. To
drop a database on the file system, delete the database
directory with operating system commands. The database must not be booted
when you remove a database. You can get a list of booted databases with <i>getPropertyInfo</i>.</p>
<p>To back up a database, you can use the online backup utility. For information
on this utility, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph></cite>.</p>
<p>You can also use <i>roll-forward recovery</i> to recover a damaged database. <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> accomplishes roll-forward
recovery by using a full backup copy of the database, archived logs, and active
logs from the most recent time before a failure. For more information on roll-forward
recovery see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph></cite>.</p>
