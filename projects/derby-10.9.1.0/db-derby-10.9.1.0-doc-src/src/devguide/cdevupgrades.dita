<conbody>
<p>Upgrading involves writing changes to the system tables, so it is not possible
for databases on read-only media. The upgrade process:</p>
<ul>
<li>marks the database as upgraded to the current release (Version <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#vers/shortversionnumber"></ph>).</li>
<li>allows use of new features.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the release notes for more information on upgrading your databases
to this version of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
