<p>See the <codeph>index.html</codeph> file for pointers to information on <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p>
<p>The distribution includes setup scripts that use an environment
variable called <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph>.
The variable's value is set to the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> base
directory.</p>
<codeblock>C:&gt;echo %<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph>%
C:\<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productinstallpath"></ph></codeblock>
<p>If you want to set your own environment, <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citgetstart"></ph></cite> instructs
you on setting its value to the directory in which you installed the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> software.</p>
<p>The distribution for <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> contains
all the files you need, including the documentation set, some example applications,
and a sample database.</p>
<p>Details about the installation:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>index.html </i>in the top-level directory is the top page for the on-line
documentation.</li>
<li><i>RELEASE-NOTES.html</i>, in the top-level <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> base
directory, contains important last-minute information. <i>Read it first</i>.</li>
<li><i>/bin</i> contains utilities and scripts for running <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>. </li>
<li><i>/demo</i> contains some sample applications, useful scripts, and prebuilt
