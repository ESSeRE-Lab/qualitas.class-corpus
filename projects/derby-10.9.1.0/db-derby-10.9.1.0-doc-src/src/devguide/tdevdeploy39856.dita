<title>Accessing databases within a jar file using the classpath</title>
<shortdesc>Once an archive containing one or more <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> databases
has been created it can be placed in the classpath. This allows access to
a database from within an application without the application's knowing the
path of the archive.</shortdesc>
