<title>Conventions for specifying the database path</title>
<shortdesc>When you access databases from the file system (instead of from
the classpath or a jar file), any path that is not absolute is interpreted as
relative to the system directory.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Databases<indexterm>convention for specifying connection
path when outside system</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>directory subsubprotocol</indexterm>
</keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>The path must do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>refer to a previously created <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database</li>
<li>specify the <i>create=true</i> attribute</li>
</ul>
<p>The path separator in the connection URL is / (forward slash), as in the
standard <i>file:// </i>URL protocol.</p>
<p>You can specify only databases that are local to the machine on which the
JVM is running. NFS file systems on UNIX and remote shared files on Windows
(//<i>machine/directory</i>) are not guaranteed to work. Using <i>derby.system.home</i> and
forward slashes is recommended practice for platform independent applications.</p>
<p>If two different database name values, relative or absolute, refer to the
same actual directory, they are considered equivalent. This means that connections
to a database through its absolute path and its relative path are connections
to the same database. Within <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>,
the name of the database is defined by the canonical path of its directory
from <cite>java.io.File.getCanonicalPath</cite>.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> automatically
creates any intermediate directory that does not already exist when creating
a new database. If it cannot create the intermediate directory, the database
creation fails.</p>
