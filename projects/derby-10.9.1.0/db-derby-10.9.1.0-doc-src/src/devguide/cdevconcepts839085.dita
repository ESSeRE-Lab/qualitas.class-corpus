<title>Explicitly closing Statements, ResultSets, and Connections</title>
<shortdesc>You should explicitly close <i>Statements</i>, <codeph><i>ResultSets,</i></codeph> and <codeph><i>Connections</i></codeph> when
you no longer need them.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>Connections to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> are
resources external to an application, and the garbage collector will not close
them automatically. </p>
<p>For example, close a <i>Statement</i> object using its <codeph><i>close</i></codeph> method;
close a <codeph><i>Connection</i></codeph> object using its <codeph><i>close</i></codeph> method.
If auto-commit is disabled, active transactions need to be explicitly committed
or rolled back before closing the connection</p>
