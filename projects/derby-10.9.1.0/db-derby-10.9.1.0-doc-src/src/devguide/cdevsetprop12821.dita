<conbody>
<p>Database-wide properties, which affect a single database, are stored within
the database itself. This allows different databases within a single <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
to have different properties and ensures that the properties are correctly
retained when a database is moved away from its original system or copied.</p>
<p>You should use database-wide properties wherever possible for ease
of deployment and for security.</p>
<p>You set and verify database-wide properties using system procedures within SQL statements.</p>
<p>To set a property, you connect to the database, create a statement, and
then use the <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY</codeph> procedure,
passing the name of the property and the value.</p>
<p>To check the current value of a property, you connect to the database,
create a statement, and then use the <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_DATABASE_PROPERTY</codeph> function, passing in the name of the property.  </p>
<p>If you specify an invalid value, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> uses the default value for
the property. (If you call the
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_DATABASE_PROPERTY</codeph> function, however, it
displays the invalid value.)</p>
<p>See the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph></cite> for more information on how to use these system
functions and procedures.</p>
