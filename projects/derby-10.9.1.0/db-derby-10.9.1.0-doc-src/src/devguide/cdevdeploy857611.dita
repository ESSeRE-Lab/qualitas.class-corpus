<title>Requirements for dynamic changes</title>
<shortdesc>Certain conditions must be met for <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
be able to load the new classes right away without you having to reboot.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<ul>
<li>You <i>originally configured</i> database-level class loading for the
database correctly. Turning on the database-level class loading property requires
setting the <i>derby.database.classpath</i> property with
valid two-part names, then rebooting.</li>
<li>If changes to the <i>derby.database.classpath</i> property are needed
to reflect new jar files, you change the property to a valid value.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these requirements are not met, you will have to reboot to see the changes.</p>
</conbody>
