<step><cmd>Commit all transactions and shut down <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
the prescribed manner. If you do not shut down <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> in
the prescribed manner, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will
need to perform recovery the next time the system boots. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> cannot
perform recovery on read-only media.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Delete the <i>tmp</i> directory if one was created within your
database directory. If you include this directory, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will
attempt to delete it and will return errors when attempting to boot a database
on read-only media.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>For the read-only database, set the property <i>derby.storage.tempDirectory</i> to
a writable location.</cmd><info><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> needs
to write to temporary files for large sorts required by such SQL statements
as ORDER BY, UNION, DISTINCT, and GROUP BY. For more information about this
property, see the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.<codeblock>derby.storage.tempDirectory=c:/temp/mytemp</codeblock></info>

<step><cmd>Configure the database to send error messages to a writable file
or to an output stream.</cmd><info>For information on the
