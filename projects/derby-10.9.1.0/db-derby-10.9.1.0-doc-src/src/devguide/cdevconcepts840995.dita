<title>Holdable result sets and autocommit</title>
<shortdesc>When autocommit is on, a positioned update or delete
statement will automatically cause the transaction to commit.

<p>If the result set has holdability 
<codeph>ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT</codeph>, combined with
autocommit on, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
gives an exception on positioned updates and deletes because the
cursor is closed immediately before the positioned statement is
commenced, as mandated by JDBC. In contrast, no such implicit commit
is done when using result set updates methods.
