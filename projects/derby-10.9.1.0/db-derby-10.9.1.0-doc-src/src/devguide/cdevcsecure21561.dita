<conbody>
<p>By writing your own class that fulfills some minimal requirements, you
can hook <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> up to an <i>external
authentication service</i> other than LDAP. To do so, specify an external
authentication service by setting the property <codeph><i>derby.authentication.provider</i></codeph> to
a class name that you want <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to
load at startup.</p>
<p>The class that provides the external authentication service must implement
the public interface <i>org.apache.derby.authentication</i>.<i>UserAuthenticator</i> and
throw exceptions of the type <i>java.sql.SQLException</i> where appropriate.</p>
<p>Using a user-defined class makes <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> adaptable
to various naming and directory services.</p>
