<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> supports disk
encryption and requires an encryption provider. An encryption provider
implements the Java cryptography concepts. The JRE for Java SE 1.4 and
higher includes Java Cryptographic Extensions (JCE, part of the
Java Cryptography Architecture) and one or more default encryption providers.
