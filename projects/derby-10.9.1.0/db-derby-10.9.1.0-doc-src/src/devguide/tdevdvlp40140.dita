<title>Booting an encrypted database</title>
<shortdesc>You must specify several attributes in the URL when you boot an
encrypted database. You must specify these attributes the first time that
you connect to the database within a JVM session, or after you shut the database
down within the same JVM session.</shortdesc>

<context><p>To boot an existing encrypted database: </p></context>
<steps>
<step><cmd>The attribute that you specify depends on how the database was
originally encrypted: </cmd>
<choices>
<choice>If the database was encrypted using the bootPassword mechanism, specify
the <i>bootPassword</i> attribute. For example:<codeblock>jdbc:derby:wombat;bootPassword=clo760uds2caPe </codeblock></choice>
<choice>If the database was encrypted using an external key, specify the <i>encryptionKey</i> attribute.
For example: <codeblock>jdbc:derby:flintstone;encryptionAlgorithm=AES/CBC/NoPadding;
encryptionKey=c566bab9ee8b62a5ddb4d9229224c678 </codeblock><p>If the algorithm
that was used when the database was created is not the default algorithm,
you must also specify the <i>encryptionAlgorithm</i> attribute. The default
encryption algorithm used by <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is
DES/CBC/NoPadding.</p></choice>
