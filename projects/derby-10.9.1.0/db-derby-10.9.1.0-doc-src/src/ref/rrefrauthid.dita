<title>AuthorizationIdentifier</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>User names within the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
are known as <i>authorization identifiers</i>. The authorization identifier
represents the name of the user, if one has been provided in the connection
request. The default schema for a user is equal to its authorization identifier.
User names can be case-sensitive within the authentication system, but they
are always case-insensitive within <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s
authorization system unless they are delimited. For more information, see
the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite>.</p></section>
