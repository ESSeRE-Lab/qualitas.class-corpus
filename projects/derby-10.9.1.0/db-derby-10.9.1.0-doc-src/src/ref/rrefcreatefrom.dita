<refbody>
<section><title>Function</title> <p>You can specify the <i>createFrom=path</i> attribute
in the boot time connection URL to create a database using a full backup at
a specified location. If there is a database with the same name in derby.system.home,
an error will occur and the existing database will be left intact. If there
is not an existing database with the same name in the current derby.system.home
location, the whole database is copied from the backup location to the derby.system.home
location and started. </p> <p>The Log files are copied to the default location.
The logDevice attribute can be used in conjunction with <i>createFrom=path</i> to
store logs in a different location. With <i>createFrom=path</i> you do not
need to copy the individual log files to the log directory.</p> 
<p>For more information about using this attribute, see "Creating a database
from a backup copy" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p>
