<title>XAConnections, user names and passwords</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>If a user opens an <i>XAConnection</i> with a user name and password,
the transaction it created cannot be attached to an <i>XAConnection</i> opened
with a different user name and password. A transaction created with an <i>XAConnection</i> without
a user name and password can be attached to any <i>XAConnection</i>.</p></section>
<section><p>However, the user name and password for recovered global transactions
are lost; any <i>XAConnection</i> can commit or roll back that in-doubt transaction.
   <note>Use the network client driver's XA DataSource interface (org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource) when XA support is required in a remote (client/server) environment.</note></p></section>
