<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Defines the percentage of space reserved for updates on an on-disk database
page for tables only (not indexes); indicates the percentage of space to keep
free on a page when inserting. Leaving reserved space on a page can minimize
row overflow (and the associated performance hit) during updates. Once a page
has been filled up to the reserved-space threshold, no new rows are allowed
on the page. This reserved space is used only for rows that increase in size
when updated, not for new inserts. Set this property prior to issuing the
CREATE TABLE statement.</p>
<p>Regardless of the value of <i>derby.storage.pageReservedSpace</i>, an empty
page always accepts at least one row.</p>

<section><title>Minimum value</title>
<p>The minimum value is 0% and the maximum is 100%. If you specify a value
outside this range, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
uses the default value of 20%.</p>

<p>This property is dynamic: if you change it while
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is running, the change
takes effect immediately. For information about dynamic changes to properties,
