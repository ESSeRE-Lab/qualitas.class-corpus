<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EMPTY_STATEMENT_CACHE system procedure</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EMPTY_STATEMENT_CACHE</codeph> stored
procedure removes as many compiled statements (plans) as possible from the
database-wide statement cache. The procedure does not remove statements related
to currently executing queries or to activations that are about to be garbage
collected, so the cache is not guaranteed to be completely empty after a call
to this procedure.</p></section>

<section><title>Execute privileges</title>
<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this procedure by default. See "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information. The
database owner can grant access to other users.</p>
