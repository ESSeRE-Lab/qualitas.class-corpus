<title>schemaName</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>A <i>schemaName</i> represents a <i>schema</i>. Schemas contain
other dictionary objects, such as tables and indexes. Schemas provide a way
to name a subset of tables and other dictionary objects within a database.</p></section>
<section><p>You can explicitly create or drop a schema. The default user schema
is the <i>APP</i> schema (if no user name is specified at connection time).
You cannot create objects in schemas starting with SYS.</p></section>
<section><p>Thus, you can qualify references to tables with the schema name.
When a schemaName is not specified, the default schema name is implicitly
inserted. System tables are placed in the <i>SYS</i> schema. You must qualify
all references to system tables with the <i>SYS</i> schema identifier. For
more information about system tables, see <xref href="rrefsistabs38369.dita#rrefsistabs38369"></xref>.</p></section>
<section><p>A schema is hierarchically the highest level of dictionary object,
so you cannot qualify a schemaName.</p></section>
