<title>System procedures for storing jar files in a database</title>
<conbody>
<p><codeph>SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR</codeph>, <codeph>SQLJ.REMOVE_JAR</codeph>, and
<codeph>SQLJ.REPLACE_JAR</codeph> are a set of procedures in the SQLJ schema
that allow you to store jar files in a database.</p>
<p>Your jar file has two names:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>physical name</i> (the name you gave it when you created it)</li>
<li>A <i><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> name</i> (the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> identifier you give it
when you load it into a particular schema). The
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> name, an
<i><xref href="crefsqlj34834.dita#crefsqlj34834">SQL92Identifier</xref></i>, can
be delimited and must be unique within a schema.</li>
</ul>
<p>A single schema can store more than one jar file.</p>
<p>For more information on when and how to use these procedures, see the section
"Loading classes from a database" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
