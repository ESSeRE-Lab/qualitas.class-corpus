<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE system function</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE</codeph> function
checks the specified table, ensuring that all of its indexes are consistent
with the base table.  If the table and indexes are consistent, the method returns a SMALLINT
with value 1. If the table and indexes are inconsistent, the function will throw an exception.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you run SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE on the tables in
a database offline after you back it up. Do not discard the previous backup
until you have verified the consistency of the current one. Otherwise, check
consistency only if there are indications that such a check is needed (for
example, if you experience hardware or operating system failure), because a
consistency check can take a long time on a large database. See "Checking
database consistency" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph> for
more information.</p>

<refsyn><title>Syntax</title> <codeblock>SMALLINT SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE(IN SCHEMANAME VARCHAR(128),
IN TABLENAME VARCHAR(128)) </codeblock> <p>An error will occur if either SCHEMANAME
or TABLENAME are null.</p></refsyn>
<section><title>Execute privileges</title>
<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this function by default. See "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information. The
database owner can grant access to other users.</p>
</section>
<example><title>Examples</title> 
<p>Check a single table:</p>
<codeblock>VALUES SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE('SALES', 'ORDERS');</codeblock>
<p>Check all tables:</p>
<codeblock>SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
    SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE(schemaname, tablename) 
  FROM sys.sysschemas s, sys.systables t 
  WHERE s.schemaid = t.schemaid;</codeblock>
