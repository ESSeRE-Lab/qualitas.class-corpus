<refbody>
<section> <p>The concatenation operator, ||, concatenates its right operand
to the end of its left operand. It operates on a character or bit expression.</p> <p>Because
all built-in data types are implicitly converted to strings, this function
can act on all built-in data types.</p></section>
<refsyn><title>Syntax</title> <codeblock><b>{
    { <i>CharacterExpression</i> || <i>CharacterExpression</i> } |
    <i>{ BitExpression</i> || <i>BitExpression</i> }
}</b></codeblock> <p>For character strings, if both the left and right operands
are of type CHAR, the resulting type is CHAR; otherwise, it is VARCHAR. The
normal blank padding/trimming rules for CHAR and VARCHAR apply to the result
of this operator.</p> <p>The length of the resulting string is the sum of
the lengths of both operands. </p> <p>For bit strings, if both the left and
the right operands are of type CHAR FOR BIT DATA, the resulting type is CHAR
FOR BIT DATA; otherwise, it is VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA.</p> </refsyn>
