<title>Caching user DNs</title>
<prolog>
</prolog>
<refbody>
<section><p>This property caches user DNs (distinguished names) locally when
<i><xref href="rrefproper13766.dita#rrefproper13766">derby.authentication.provider</xref></i>
is set to <i>LDAP</i> and
<i><xref href="rrefproper37341.dita#rrefproper37341">derby.authentication.ldap.searchFilter</xref></i>
is set to <i>derby.user</i>. When you provide a user DN with this property,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is able to avoid an
LDAP search for that user's DN before authenticating. For those users without
DNs defined with this property,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> performs a search using
the default value of <i>derby.authentication.ldap.searchFilter</i>.</p>
