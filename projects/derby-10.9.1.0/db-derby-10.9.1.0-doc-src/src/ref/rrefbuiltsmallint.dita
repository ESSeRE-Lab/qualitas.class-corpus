<section>The SMALLINT function returns a small integer representation of a
number or character string in the form of a small integer constant.</section>
<refsyn><title>Syntax</title> <codeblock>SMALLINT ( <i>NumericExpression</i> | <i>CharacterExpression</i> )</codeblock> <dl>
<dlentry>
<dt>NumericExpression</dt>
<dd>An expression that returns a value of any built-in numeric data type.
 If the argument is a NumericExpression, the result is the same number that
would occur if the argument were assigned to a small integer column or variable.
If the whole part of the argument is not within the range of small integers,
an error occurs. The decimal part of the argument is truncated if present.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>CharacterExpression</dt>
<dd>An expression that returns a character string value of length not greater
than the maximum length of a character constant. Leading and trailing blanks
are eliminated and the resulting string must conform to the rules for forming
an SQL integer constant. However, the value of the constant must be in the
range of small integers. The character string cannot be a long string.  If
the argument is a CharacterExpression, the result is the same number that
would occur if the corresponding integer constant were assigned to a small
integer column or variable.</dd>
</dlentry></dl> <p>The result of the function is a small integer. If the argument
can be null, the result can be null. If the argument is null, the result is
the null value.</p> </refsyn>
<example><title>Examples</title><p>To determine the small integer representation
of the number 32767.99, use this clause:<codeblock>VALUES SMALLINT (32767.99)</codeblock>The
result is 32767. </p><p>To determine the small integer representation of the
number 1, use this clause: <codeblock>VALUES SMALLINT (1)</codeblock>The result
is 1. </p></example>
