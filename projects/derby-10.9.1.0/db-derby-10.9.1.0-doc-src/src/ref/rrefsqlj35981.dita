<section><title>Statement dependency system</title>
<p>A searched delete statement depends on the table being updated,
all of its conglomerates (units of storage such as heaps or indexes), and
any other table named in the WHERE clause. A CREATE or DROP INDEX statement
for the target table of a prepared searched delete statement invalidates the
prepared searched delete statement.</p></section>
<section><p>The positioned delete statement depends on the cursor and any
tables the cursor references. You can compile a positioned delete even if
the cursor has not been opened yet. However, removing the open cursor with
the JDBC <i>close</i> method invalidates the positioned delete.</p></section>
<section><p>A CREATE or DROP INDEX statement for the target table of a prepared
