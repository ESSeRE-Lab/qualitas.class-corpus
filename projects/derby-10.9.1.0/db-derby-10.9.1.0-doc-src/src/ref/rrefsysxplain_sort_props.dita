    <section><p>See "Working with RunTimeStatistics" in
         <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/cittuning"></ph> for information
         on how to configure this.</p>
<p>Rows in this table are typically joined with rows in
            SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS and SYSXPLAIN_RESULTSETS during analysis.</p>
<codeblock>select s.stmt_text, rs.op_identifier,

    where rs.stmt_id = s.stmt_id and rs.sort_rs_id = srt.sort_rs_id</codeblock>
            <p>Rows in this table are added
                automatically when
                <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
                has been configured appropriately. The
          rows remain in the table until you delete them or drop the table.</p>

table.</p>

    The code values include <i>'IN'</i> for an internal sort, and <i>'EX'</i>
    for an external sort. An internal sort is one which was entirely
    performed in-memory and did not overflow to any temporary files, while an
external sort used one or more external files.</entry>

<entry colname="5">Number of merge runs which were provided. This value
    will be NULL for an internal sort, but for an external sort it
    indicates how many times the intermediate sort files were merged together.
    External sorts are far more expensive than internal sorts, and each
    additional merge run that an external sort must perform adds
    considerably more to the overhead of the sort.</entry>

    eliminated duplicates from the input. Valid values are <i>'Y'</i> and
    <i>'N'</i>.
    This column only applies for a sort which was NOT performing GROUP BY
    aggregation; for GROUP BY sorts this column is always NULL. See the
    DISTINCT_AGGREGATE column for the corresponding information for
    aggregating sorts.
