<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Specifies the size of the replication log buffers in bytes. These buffers
store the log on the master side before it is shipped to the slave. There is a
total of 10 such buffers. Large buffers increase memory usage but reduce
the chance that the buffers will fill up (in turn increasing response time for
transactions on the master, as described in the failure situation "The master
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> instance is not able
to send log data to the slave at the same pace as the log is generated" in the
topic "Replication failure handling" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>).</p>
<p>You can also use the properties

and
<i><xref href="rrefpropermaxlogshippinginterval.dita#rrefpropermaxlogshippinginterval"></xref></i>
to tune the rate at which the log is shipped from the master to the slave.</p>
