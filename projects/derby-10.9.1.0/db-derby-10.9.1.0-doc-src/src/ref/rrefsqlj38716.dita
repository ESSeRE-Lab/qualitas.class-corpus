<section> <p>COUNT is an aggregate function that counts the number of rows
accessed in an expression (see <xref href="rrefsqlj33923.dita#rrefsqlj33923"></xref>).
COUNT is allowed on all types of expressions.</p></section>
<refsyn><title>Syntax</title><codeblock><b>COUNT ( [ DISTINCT | ALL ] <i>Expression</i> ) </b></codeblock><p>The
DISTINCT qualifier eliminates duplicates. The ALL qualifier retains duplicates.
ALL is assumed if neither ALL nor DISTINCT is specified. For example, if a
column contains the values 1, 1, 1, 1, and 2, COUNT(col) returns a greater
value than COUNT(DISTINCT col).</p><p>Only one DISTINCT aggregate expression
per <i><xref href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression">SelectExpression</xref></i> is
allowed. For example, the following query is not allowed:</p><codeblock><b><ph>-- query not allowed</ph>
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT flying_time), SUM (DISTINCT miles)
FROM Flights</b></codeblock><p>An <i>Expression</i> can contain multiple column
references or expressions, but it cannot contain another aggregate or subquery.
If an <i>Expression</i> evaluates to NULL, the aggregate is not processed
for that value.</p><p>The resulting data type of COUNT is <xref href="rrefsqlj10696.dita#rrefsqlj10696">INTEGER</xref>.</p> </refsyn>
<example><title>Example</title>
<codeblock><b><ph>-- Count the number of countries in each region,
-- show only regions that have at least 2</ph>
SELECT COUNT (country), region
FROM Countries
GROUP BY region
HAVING COUNT (country) &gt; 1</b></codeblock> </example>
