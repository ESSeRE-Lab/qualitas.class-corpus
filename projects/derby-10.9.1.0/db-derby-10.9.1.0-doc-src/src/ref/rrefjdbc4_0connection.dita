JDBC 4.0 adds new capabilities to Connections:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>LOB creation</b> - New methods, <i>createBlob()</i> and
<i>createClob()</i> let you create empty Blobs and Clobs, which you
can then fill up before stuffing into a column.</li>
<li><b>Validity tracking</b> - The <i>isValid</i> method tells you
whether your Connection is still alive.</li>
</ul>
