<section>
<p>This procedure is used in conjunction with NATIVE authentication. For
details about NATIVE authentication, see
<i><xref href="rrefproper13766.dita#rrefproper13766">derby.authentication.provider</xref></i>
and "Using NATIVE authentication" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to remove the user account of the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref>.</p>
<p>If you use this procedure to remove a user account, the schemas and data
objects owned by the user remain in the database and can be accessed only by
the database owner or by other users who have been granted access to them. If
the user is created again, the user regains access to the schemas and data
objects.</p>

<section><title>Syntax</title>
<codeblock>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_DROP_USER(IN USERNAME VARCHAR(128))</codeblock> 
<p>No result set is returned by this procedure.</p>
<dl><dlentry>
<dt>USERNAME</dt>
<dd>A user name that is case-sensitive if you place the name string in double
quotes. This user name is an authorization identifier.
See "Authorization identifiers, user authentication, and user authorization" in
the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information about
how these names are treated. If the user name is that of the database owner,
an error is raised.</dd>

<section><title>Execute privileges</title>
<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this procedure by default. See "Using NATIVE
authentication," "Enabling user authentication," and "Setting the SQL standard
authorization mode" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for
more information. The database owner can grant access to other users.</p>
