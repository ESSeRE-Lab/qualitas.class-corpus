<section><p>A <i>cursor-Name</i> refers to a cursor. No SQL language command
exists to <i>assign</i> a name to a cursor. Instead, you use the JDBC API
to assign names to cursors or to retrieve system-generated names. For more
information, see the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite>.
If you assign a name to a cursor, you can refer to that name from within SQL
statements.</p></section>
