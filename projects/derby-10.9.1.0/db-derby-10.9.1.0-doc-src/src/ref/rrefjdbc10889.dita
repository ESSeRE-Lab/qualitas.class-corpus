<section><p>You can supply an optional list of attributes to a database connection
URL. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> translates these
attributes into properties, so you can also set attributes in a <i>Properties</i> object
passed to <i>DriverManager.getConnection</i>. (You cannot set those attributes
as system properties, only in an object passed to the <i>DriverManager.getConnection</i> method.)
If you specify any attributes both on the connection URL and in a
<i>Properties</i> object, the attributes on the connection URL override the
attributes in the <i>Properties</i> object.</p></section>
<section><p>These attributes are specific to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> and
are listed in <xref href="rrefattrib24612.dita#rrefattrib24612"></xref>.</p></section>
<section><p>Attribute name/value pairs are converted into properties and added
to the properties provided in the connection call. If no properties are provided
in the connection call, a properties set is created that contains only the
properties obtained from the database connection URL.   <codeblock><b>import java.util.Properties;

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:sampleDB;create=true");

<ph>/* setting an attribute in a Properties object */</ph>
Properties myProps = new Properties();
myProps.put("create", "true");
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:sampleDB", myProps);

<ph>/* passing user name and password */</ph>
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:sampleDB", "dba", "password");</b></codeblock></p></section>
<section> <note>Attributes are not parsed for correctness. If you pass in
an incorrect attribute or corresponding value, it is simply ignored. (<ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does provide a tool for
parsing the correctness of attributes. For more information, see the <cite><ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citutilities"></ph></cite>.)</note></section>
