<title>Scope of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties</title>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>A property in <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> belongs
to one or more of these scopes:<ul id="i1008301">
<li id="rrefproper41229"><i>system-wide</i>   <p>System-wide properties apply
to an entire system, including all its databases and tables if applicable.</p>
<ul compact="yes">
<li>Set programmatically<p>System-wide properties set
programmatically have precedence over database-wide properties and system-wide
properties set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file.</p></li>
<li>Set in the <i>derby.properties</i> file<p>The <i>derby.properties</i> file
is an optional file that can be created to set properties at the system level
when the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> driver is
loaded. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> looks for
this file in the directory defined by the <i>derby.system.home</i> property. Any
property except <i>derby.system.home</i> can be set by including it in the <i>derby.properties</i> file.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li id="rrefproper15705"><i>database-wide</i>   <p>A database-wide property
is stored in a database and is valid for that specific database only.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<note>Database-wide properties are stored in the database and are simpler and
safer for deployment. System-wide properties can be more practical during the
development process.</note>
<p>For more information about scopes, precedence, and persistence, see
"Properties overview" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
