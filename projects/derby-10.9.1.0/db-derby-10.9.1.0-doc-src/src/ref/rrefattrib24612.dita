<title>Setting attributes for the database connection URL </title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> allows
you to supply a list of attributes to its database connection URL, which is
a JDBC feature.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>The attributes are specific to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.</p></section>
<section><p>You typically set attributes in a semicolon-separated list following
the protocol and subprotocol (and, in some cases, the subsubprotocol). For
information on how you set attributes, see <xref
href="rrefjdbc10889.dita#rrefjdbc10889"></xref>. This section provides reference
information only.</p>
<p>The <i>DriverManager.getConnection</i> method can take both a connection URL
and a <i>Properties</i> object as arguments. If you specify any attributes both
on the connection URL and in a <i>Properties</i> object, the attributes on the
connection URL override the attributes in the <i>Properties</i> object.</p>
</section>
<section> <note>Attributes are not parsed for correctness. If you pass in
an incorrect attribute or corresponding value, it is simply ignored.</note></section>
