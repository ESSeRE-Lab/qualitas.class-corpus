<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Upgrades a database that was created using an earlier version of
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to the current version
of <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, then connects to
it. If the database does not exist, an error appears in the error log and the
connection attempt fails with an <i>SQLException</i> indicating that the
database cannot be found.</p>
<p>This operation performs a full upgrade, as defined in "Upgrading a database"
in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>. For more information
about upgrades, see the other topics under "Upgrades" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
<p>For a database for which authentication and SQL authorization are both
enabled, only the <xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database
owner</xref> can perform a full upgrade. See also "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You cannot perform a full upgrade on a database already booted
    in soft upgrade mode. If a database is already booted in soft upgrade mode,
    the <i>upgrade=true</i> attribute will have no effect.
    If a database is already booted in soft upgrade mode,
    you can first shutdown the database with the
    <i><xref href="rrefattrib16471.dita#rrefattrib16471">shutdown=true</xref></i>
    attribute and then connect with <i>upgrade=true</i> to perform the upgrade.

<section><title>Combining with other attributes</title>
<p>You must specify a <i>databaseName</i> (after the subprotocol in the
database connection URL) or a
<i><xref href="rrefattrib17246.dita#rrefattrib17246">databaseName=nameofDatabase</xref></i>
attribute with this attribute.</p>
<p>You cannot combine this attribute with the
<i><xref href="rrefattribcollation.dita#rrefattribcollation">collation</xref></i>
or <i><xref href="rrefattrib56769.dita#rrefattrib56769">territory=ll_CC</xref></i>
attributes.</p>
