<section><p><i>DatabaseMetaData</i> result sets are closed if a user performs
any other action on a JDBC object that causes an automatic <i>commit</i> to
occur. If you need the <i>DatabaseMetaData</i> result sets to be accessible
while executing other actions that would cause automatic commits, turn off
auto-commit with <i>setAutoCommit(false)</i>.</p></section>
