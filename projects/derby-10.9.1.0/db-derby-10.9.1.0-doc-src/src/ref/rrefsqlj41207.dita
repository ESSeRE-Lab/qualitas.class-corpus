value whose length is less than specified. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> truncates
spaces from a string value when a length greater than the VARCHAR expected
is provided. Characters other than spaces are not truncated, and instead cause
an exception to be raised. When <xref href="rrefsqlj23075.dita#rrefsqlj23075">comparison boolean operators</xref> are applied to
VARCHARs, the lengths of the operands are not altered, and spaces at the end
of the values are ignored.</p> <p>When CHARs and VARCHARs are mixed in expressions,
the shorter value is padded with spaces to the length of the longer value.</p> <p>The
type of a string constant is CHAR, not VARCHAR.</p> </section>
