}</b></codeblock><p>You can arbitrarily put parentheses around queries, or
use the parentheses to control the order of evaluation of the INTERSECT, EXCEPT,
or UNION operations. These operations are evaluated from left to right when
no parentheses are present, with the exception of INTERSECT operations, which
would be evaluated before any UNION or EXCEPT operations.</p></refsyn>
<section><title>Duplicates in UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT ALL results</title><p>The
ALL and DISTINCT keywords determine whether duplicates are eliminated from
the result of the operation. If you specify the DISTINCT keyword, then the
result will have no duplicate rows. If you specify the ALL keyword, then there
may be duplicates in the result, depending on whether there were duplicates
in the input.  DISTINCT is the default, so if you don't specify ALL or DISTINCT,
the duplicates will be eliminated.  For example, UNION builds an intermediate <i>ResultSet</i> with
all of the rows from both queries and eliminates the duplicate rows before
returning the remaining rows. UNION ALL returns all rows from both queries
as the result.</p><p> Depending on which operation is specified, if the number
of copies of a row in the left table is L and the number of copies of that
row in the right table is R, then the number of duplicates of that particular
row that the output table contains (assuming the ALL keyword is specified)
is:<ul>
<li>UNION: ( L + R ).</li>
<li>EXCEPT: the maximum of ( L - R ) and 0 (zero).</li>
<li>INTERSECT: the minimum of L and R.</li>
</ul></p></section>
