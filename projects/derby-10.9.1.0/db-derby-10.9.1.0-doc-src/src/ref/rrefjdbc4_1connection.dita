JDBC 4.1 adds new features to the <i>Connection</i> interface:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aborting connections</b> - The <i>abort(Executor)</i> method aborts
a running connection. Outstanding transactional work is rolled back, and the
physical connection to the database is destroyed. When running under a Java
<i>SecurityManager</i>, this method can be called only if
<i>SQLPermission("callAbort")</i> has been granted both to the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> JDBC driver (in
<i>derby.jar</i> and <i>derbyclient.jar</i>) and to the
application code that calls <i>Connection.abort()</i>. For security reasons,
permission to execute this method should not be granted lightly. Do not grant
this permission to application code unless you are certain that only superusers
can invoke the code. For more information, see "Granting permissions to 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</li>
</ul>
