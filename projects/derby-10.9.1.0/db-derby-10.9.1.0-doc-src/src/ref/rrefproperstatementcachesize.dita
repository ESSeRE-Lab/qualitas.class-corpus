<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Defines the size, in number of statements, of the database statement cache
(prepared statements kept in memory).</p>
<p>This property controls the number of precompiled statements which
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> keeps in its statement
cache. Consider raising this number if statement preparation is taking too much
time.</p>
<p>For more information on the statement cache, see "Using the statement cache"
in <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/cittuning"></ph>.</p>
<p>Set this property to zero if you find that deadlocks are occurring when
prepared statements become outdated. These deadlocks can happen in
multi-threaded applications that alternate selects and updates.</p>
</section>
<section><title>Default</title>
<p>100 statements.</p>

does not take effect until you reboot.</p>
