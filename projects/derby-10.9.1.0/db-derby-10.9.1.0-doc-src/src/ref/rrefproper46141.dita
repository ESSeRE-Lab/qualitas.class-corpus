<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Specifies the number of seconds after which
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> aborts a transaction
when it is waiting for a lock. When
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> aborts (and rolls back)
the transaction, the transaction receives an <i>SQLException</i> of
<i>SQLState</i> 40XL1.</p>
<p>The time specified by this property is approximate.</p>
<p>A zero value for this property means that
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> aborts a transaction
any time it cannot immediately obtain a lock that it requests.</p>
<p>A negative value for this property is equivalent to an infinite wait time;
the transaction waits forever to obtain the lock.</p>
<p>If this property is set to a value greater than or equal to zero but less
than the value of
<i><xref href="rrefproper10607.dita#rrefproper10607">derby.locks.deadlockTimeout</xref></i>,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> never performs any
deadlock checking.</p>
