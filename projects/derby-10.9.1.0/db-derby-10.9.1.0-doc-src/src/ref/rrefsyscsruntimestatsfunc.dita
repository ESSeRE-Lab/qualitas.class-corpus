<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS system function</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS</codeph> function
returns a VARCHAR(32672) value representing the query execution plan and run
time statistics for a java.sql.ResultSet. A query execution plan is a tree
of execution nodes. There are a number of possible node types. Statistics
are accumulated during execution at each node. The types of statistics include
the amount of time spent in specific operations, the number of rows passed
to the node by its children, and the number of rows returned by the node to
its parent. (The exact statistics are specific to each node type.)   <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS</codeph> is
most meaningful for DML statements such as SELECT, INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.</p></section>
