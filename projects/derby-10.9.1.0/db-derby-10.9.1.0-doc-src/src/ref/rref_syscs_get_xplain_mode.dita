<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_XPLAIN_MODE</codeph> function
returns the current xplain mode.</p><p>If
the xplain mode is non-zero, then statements are not actually executed, but
are just compiled, and their statistics recorded in the SYSXPLAIN_* database
tables. If the xplain mode is zero (the default), then statements are
executed normally.
