<conbody>
<p>You can prepare statements that are allowed to have parameters for which
the value is not specified when the statement is prepared using <i>PreparedStatement</i> methods
in the JDBC API. These parameters are called dynamic parameters and are represented
by a ?.</p>
<p>The JDBC API documents refer to dynamic parameters as IN, INOUT, or OUT
parameters. In SQL, they are always IN parameters.</p>
<note othertype="New" type="other"><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> supports
the interface <i>ParameterMetaData</i>, new in JDBC 3.0. This interface describes
the number, type, and properties of prepared statement parameters. See the <cite><ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite> for more information.</note>
<p>You must specify values for them before executing the statement. The values
specified must match the types expected.</p>
