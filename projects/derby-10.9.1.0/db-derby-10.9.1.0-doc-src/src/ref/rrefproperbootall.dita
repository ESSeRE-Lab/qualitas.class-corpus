<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Specifies that all databases in the directory specified by the
<i><xref href="rrefproper32066.dita#rrefproper32066">derby.system.home</xref></i>
property should be automatically booted at startup time.</p>
<p>When this property is set to true, databases in the <i>derby.system.home</i>
directory are booted at startup. Otherwise, databases are booted when you
first connect to them.</p>
<p>You may want to use the <i>derby.system.bootAll</i> property to avoid a
delay at first connection time. After a crash, a boot that requires recovery
can take a long time, and you may want to perform this boot as soon as
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is restarted.</p>
<p>You can set the <i>derby.database.noAutoBoot</i> property on a particular
database if you want to prevent it from being automatically booted at startup.
See <i><xref href="rrefpropernoautoboot.dita#rrefpropernoautoboot"/></i> for
details.</p>
