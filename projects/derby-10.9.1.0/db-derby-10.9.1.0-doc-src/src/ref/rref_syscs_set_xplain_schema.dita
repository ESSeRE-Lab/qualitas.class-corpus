<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA system procedure</title>
<refbody>
    <section><p>This procedure allows you to request XPLAIN style processing
            of runtime statistics. When XPLAIN style is used, the runtime
            statistics are written to the SYSXPLAIN_* database tables, so
            that you can analyze the statistics by running queries against
            the tables.
            See "Working with RunTimeStatistics" in the 
            <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/cittuning"></ph>
            for additional information.
        </p></section>
<section><p>Turn xplain style on by calling this procedure with a non-empty
argument. Turn xplain style off by calling the procedure with an empty
argument.</p></section>
<section><p>The argument that you provide must be a legal schema name, and
        you should use this argument to indicate the schema in which
        runtime statistics should be captured. If the schema that you
        specify does not already exist, it will be automatically created.
        If the XPLAIN tables do not already exist in this schema, they
        will be automatically created. Runtime statistics information about
        statements executed in this session will then be captured into
        these tables, until runtime statistics capturing is halted by either
        calling <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA</codeph> with
        an empty argument or by calling
        <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS(0)</codeph></p></section>

<section><title>Execute privileges</title>
<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this procedure by default. See "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information. The
database owner can grant access to other users.</p>

<section><title>Example</title>
    <p>To cause <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
        to record statistics about statement execution in
        the SYSXPLAIN_* database tables in the schema named 'MY_STATS':</p>
    <codeblock>
        call syscs_util.syscs_set_runtimestatistics(1);
