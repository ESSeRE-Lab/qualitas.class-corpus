<section><p>Using the classes and methods of JDBC, you submit SQL statements
to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> as strings. The
character set permitted for strings containing SQL statements is Unicode.
Within these strings, the following rules apply:   <ul>
<li>Double quotation marks delimit special identifiers referred to in SQL-92
as <i>delimited identifiers</i>. </li>
<li>Single quotation marks delimit character strings.</li>
<li>Within a character string, to represent a single quotation mark or apostrophe,
use two single quotation marks. (In other words, a single quotation mark is
the escape character for a single quotation mark.)   <p>A double quotation
mark does not need an escape character. To represent a double quotation mark,
simply use a double quotation mark. However, note that in a Java
program, a double quotation mark requires the backslash escape character.</p><ph><b>Example:</b></ph><codeblock><b><ph>-- a single quotation mark is the escape character
-- for a single quotation mark</ph>

VALUES 'Joe''s umbrella'
<ph>-- in ij, you don't need to escape the double quotation marks</ph>
VALUES 'He said, "hello!"'

n = stmt.executeUpdate(
    "UPDATE aTable setStringcol = 'He said, \"hello!\"'");</b></codeblock></li>
<li>SQL keywords are case-insensitive. For example, you can type the keyword
SELECT as SELECT, Select, select, or sELECT.</li>
<li>SQL-92-style identifiers are case-insensitive (see <i><xref href="crefsqlj34834.dita#crefsqlj34834"></xref></i>),
unless they are delimited.</li>
<li>Java-style identifiers are always case-sensitive.</li>
<li>* is a wildcard within a <i><xref href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression">SelectExpression</xref>.</i> See <xref
href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression/sqlj38441"></xref>. It
can also be the multiplication operator. In all other cases, it is a syntactical
metasymbol that flags items you can repeat 0 or more times.</li>
<li>% and _ are character wildcards when used within character strings following
a LIKE operator (except when escaped with an escape character). See <xref
href="rrefsqlj23075.dita#rrefsqlj23075"></xref>.</li>
<li>Comments can be either single- or multiline as per the SQL-92 standard. Singleline
comments start with two dashes (--) and end with the newline character. Multiline 
comments are bracketed and start with forward slash star (/*), and end with star 
forward slash (*/). Note that bracketed comments may be nested. Any text between 
the starting and ending comment character sequence is ignored.</li>
</ul></p></section>
