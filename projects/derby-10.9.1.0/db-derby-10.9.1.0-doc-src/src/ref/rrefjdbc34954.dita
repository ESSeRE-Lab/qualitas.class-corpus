<section><p>To get the <i>DriverPropertyInfo</i> object, request the JDBC
driver from the driver manager:</p></section>
<example> <codeblock><b>java.sql.DriverManager.getDriver("jdbc:derby:").
    getPropertyInfo(<b><i>URL</i></b>, <b><i>Prop</i></b>)</b></codeblock></example>
<section><p>Do not request it from <i>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</i>,
which is only an intermediary class that loads the actual driver.</p></section>
<section><p>This method might return a <i>DriverPropertyInfo</i> object. In
a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system, it consists
of an array of database connection URL attributes. The most useful attribute
is <i><xref href="rrefattrib17246.dita#rrefattrib17246">databaseName=nameofDatabase</xref>,</i> which
means that the object consists of a list of booted databases in the current
system.</p></section>
<section><p>For example, if a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system
has the databases <i>toursDB</i> and <i>flightsDB</i> in its system directory,
all the databases in the system are set to boot automatically, and a user
has also connected to a database <filepath>A:/dbs/tours94</filepath>, the
array returned from <i>getPropertyInfo</i> contains one object corresponding
to the <i>databaseName</i> attribute. The choices field of the <i>DriverPropertyInfo</i> object
will contain an array of three Strings with the values <i>toursDB</i>, <i>flightsDB</i>,
and <filepath>A:/dbs/tours94</filepath>. Note that this object is returned
only if the proposed connection objects do not already include a database
name (in any form) or include the shutdown attribute with the value true.</p></section>
