<refbody>
<section> <p>SUM is an aggregate function that evaluates the sum of the
expression over a set of rows (see <xref href="rrefsqlj33923.dita#rrefsqlj33923"></xref>).
SUM is allowed only on expressions that evaluate to numeric data types.</p></section>
<refsyn><title>Syntax</title> <codeblock><b>SUM ( [ DISTINCT | ALL ] <i>Expression</i> )</b></codeblock> <p>The
DISTINCT and ALL qualifiers eliminate or retain duplicates. ALL is assumed
if neither ALL nor DISTINCT is specified. For example, if a column contains
the values 1, 1, 1, 1, and 2, SUM(col) returns a greater value than SUM(DISTINCT
col).</p> <p>Only one DISTINCT aggregate expression per <i><xref href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression">SelectExpression</xref></i> is
allowed. For example, the following query is not allowed:   <codeblock><b>SELECT AVG (DISTINCT flying_time), SUM (DISTINCT miles)
FROM Flights</b></codeblock></p> <p>The <i>Expression</i> can contain multiple
column references or expressions, but it cannot contain another aggregate
or subquery. It must evaluate to a built-in numeric data type. If an expression
evaluates to NULL, the aggregate skips that value.</p> <p>The resulting data
type is the same as the expression on which it operates (it might overflow).</p> </refsyn>
<example><title>Examples</title>
<codeblock><b>-- find all economy seats available:
SELECT SUM (economy_seats) FROM Airlines;

-- use SUM on multiple column references
-- (find the total number of all seats purchased):
SELECT SUM (economy_seats_taken + business_seats_taken + firstclass_seats_taken)
as seats_taken FROM FLIGHTAVAILABILITY;
