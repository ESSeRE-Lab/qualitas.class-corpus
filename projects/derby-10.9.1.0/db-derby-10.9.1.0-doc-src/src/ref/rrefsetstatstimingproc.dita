<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_STATISTICS_TIMING system procedure</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>Statistics timing is an attribute associated with a connection
that you turn on and off by using the <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_STATISTICS_TIMING</codeph> system
procedure.  Statistics timing is turned off by default. Turn statistics timing
on only when the <codeph>runtimestatistics</codeph> attribute is already on.
Turning statistics timing on when the <codeph>runtimestatistics</codeph> attribute
is off has no effect. </p></section>
<section><p>Turn statistics timing on by calling this procedure with a non-zero
argument. Turn statistics timing off by calling the procedure with a zero
argument.</p></section>
<section><p>When statistics timing is turned on, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> tracks
the timings of various aspects of the execution of a statement. This information
is included in the information returned by the <xref href="rrefsyscsruntimestatsfunc.dita#rrefsyscsruntimestatsfunc">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS</xref> system
function. When statistics timing is turned off, the <xref href="rrefsyscsruntimestatsfunc.dita#rrefsyscsruntimestatsfunc">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS</xref> system
function shows all timing values as zero.</p></section>
