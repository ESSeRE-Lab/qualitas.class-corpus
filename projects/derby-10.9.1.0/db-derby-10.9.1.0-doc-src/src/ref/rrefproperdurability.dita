<section><title>Function</title>
<p>This property changes the default durability of
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to improve performance
at the expense of consistency and durability of the database. The only valid
supported case insensitive value is <codeph>test</codeph>. If this property is
set to any value other than <codeph>test</codeph>, this property setting is
ignored.  When <codeph>derby.system.durability</codeph> is set to
<codeph>test</codeph>, the store system will not force I/O synchronization calls
for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The log file at each commit</li>
<li>The log file before a data page is forced to disk</li>
<li>Page allocation when a file is grown</li>
<li>Data writes during checkpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>While performance is improved, note that under these conditions, a commit no
longer guarantees that the transaction's modification will survive a system
crash or JVM termination, the database may not recover successfully upon
restart, a near-full disk at runtime may cause unexpected errors, and the
database may be in an inconsistent state.</p>
<p>If you boot the database with this property set to <codeph>test</codeph>,
the following warning message is logged in the
<codeph>derby.log</codeph> file:</p>
<codeblock>WARNING: The database is booted with derby.system.durability=test.
In this mode, it is possible that database may not be able 
to recover, committed transactions may be lost, and the database 
may be in an inconsistent state. Please use this mode only when 
these consequences are acceptable.</codeblock>
<p>A similar message will appear in the <codeph>derby.log</codeph> file if the
database was booted with <codeph>derby.system.durability=test</codeph> at any
time previously.</p>
<p>Once the database is booted with
<codeph>derby.system.durability=test</codeph>, there are no guarantees that the
database is consistent.</p>
</section>
<section><title>Default</title>
<p>This property is ignored by default.</p>
</section>
<section><title>Supported values</title>
<p>The only supported value is <codeph>test</codeph>.</p>
</section>
<example><title>Example</title>
<codeblock><b>derby.system.durability=test</b></codeblock>
<p>Since this is a system property, you can set it in the
<codeph>derby.properties</codeph> file or on the command line of the JVM when
starting the application.</p>
<p>You might enable this property when using
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> as a test database
where consistency or recoverability is not an issue.</p>
</example>
<section><title>Dynamic or static</title>
<p>This property is static; if you change it while
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> is running, the change
does not take effect until you reboot.</p>
