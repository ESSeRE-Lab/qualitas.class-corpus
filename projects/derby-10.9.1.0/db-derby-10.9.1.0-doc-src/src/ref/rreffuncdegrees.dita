<section> <p> The specified number is an angle measured in radians, which
is converted to an approximately equivalent angle measured in degrees. The
specified number must be a <xref href="rrefsqljdoubleprecision.dita#rrefsqljdoubleprecision">DOUBLE
PRECISION</xref> number. </p><p><note type="attention">The conversion from
radians to degrees is not exact. You should not expect DEGREES(ACOS(0.5))
to return exactly 60.0.</note> </p><p>The data type of the returned value is
a DOUBLE PRECISION number.</p> </section>
