<title>Statements</title>
<conbody>
<p>This section provides manual pages for both high-level language constructs
and parts thereof. For example, the CREATE INDEX statement is a high-level
statement that you can execute directly via the JDBC interface. This section
also includes clauses, which are not high-level statements and which you cannot
execute directly but only as part of a high-level statement. The ORDER BY
and WHERE clauses are examples of this kind of clause. Finally, this section
also includes some syntactically complex portions of statements called expressions,
for example <i><xref href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression">SelectExpression</xref></i> and <i><xref
href="rreftablesubquery.dita#rreftablesubquery">TableSubquery</xref>.</i> These clauses
and expressions receive their own manual pages for ease of reference.</p>
<p>Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, you can execute or prepare and
then execute all the high-level statements, which are all marked with the
word <i>statement</i>, via the interfaces provided by JDBC. This manual indicates
whether an expression can be executed as a high-level statement.</p>
<p>The sections provide general information about statement use, and
descriptions of the specific statements.</p>
