<section> <p>The SET ISOLATION statement allows a user to change
the isolation level for the user's connection. Valid levels are SERIALIZABLE,
REPEATABLE READ, READ COMMITTED, and READ UNCOMMITTED.</p> <p>Issuing this
statement always commits the current transaction. The JDBC 
<i>java.sql.Connection.setTransactionIsolation</i> method behaves almost 
identically to this command, with one exception: if you are using the embedded 
driver, and if the call to <i>java.sql.Connection.setTransactionIsolation</i>
does not actually change the isolation level (that is, if it sets the isolation 
level to its current value), the current transaction is not committed.</p> 
<p>For information about isolation levels, see "Locking, concurrency, and 
isolation"
in the <cite><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph></cite>. For 
information about the JDBC <i>java.sql.Connection.setTransactionIsolation</i> 
method, see <xref href="rrefjavcsti.dita#rrefjavcsti"></xref>.</p></section>
