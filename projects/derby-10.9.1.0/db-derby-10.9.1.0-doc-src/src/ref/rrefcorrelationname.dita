<section><p>A <i>correlation-Name</i> is given to a table expression in a
FROM clause as a new name or alias for that table. You do not qualify a <i>correlation-Name</i> with
a <i>schema-Name</i>.</p><p>You cannot use correlation-Names for updatable
columns; using correlation-Names in this way will cause an SQL exception.
For example:<codeblock>SELECT c11 AS col1, c12 AS col2, c13 FROM t1 FOR UPDATE of c11,c13
</codeblock>In this example, the correlation-Name <codeph>col1 FOR c11</codeph> is
not permitted because <codeph>c11</codeph> is listed in the FOR UPDATE list
of columns. You can use the correlation-Name <codeph>FOR c12</codeph> because
it is not in the FOR UPDATE list.</p></section>
