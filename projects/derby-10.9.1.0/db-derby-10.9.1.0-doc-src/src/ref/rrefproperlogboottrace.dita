<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Specifies whether boot errors are written to the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> log file.</p>
<p>This property helps in diagnosing double-booting problems. Typically, when
two Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) or class loaders attempt to boot
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, an error
message like the following appears:</p>
<codeblock>ERROR XJ040: Failed to start database 'testdb' with class loader 
sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@481e481e, see the next exception for
details.
ERROR XSDB6: Another instance of Derby may have already booted the
database C:\derby\testdb.</codeblock>
<p>The message will also show the stack trace and class loader of the failed
boot attempt. It is sometimes also useful to see the stack trace when the first
successful boot attempt occurred. To see the stack trace of successful boots and
shutdowns, set <i>derby.stream.error.logBootTrace=true</i> to trace the successful
attempt. If you think that both attempts should be from the same class loader
context, check also the class loader information for boot and shutdown attempts
and make sure they all come from the same class loader context.</p>
<p>For more information, see "Double-booting system behavior" in
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>

does not take effect until you reboot.</p> </section>
