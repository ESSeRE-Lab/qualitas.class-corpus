<section><title>Function</title> <p>You can specify the <i>restoreFrom=path</i> attribute
in the boot time connection URL to restore a database using a full backup
from the specified location. If a database with the same name exists in the
derby.system.home location, the whole database is deleted, copied from the
backup location, and then restarted.</p> <p>The log files are copied to the
same location they were in when the backup was taken. The logDevice attribute
can be used in conjunction with <i>restoreFrom=path</i> to store logs in a
different location.</p> 
<p>For more information about using this attribute, see "Restoring a database
from a backup copy" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p>
