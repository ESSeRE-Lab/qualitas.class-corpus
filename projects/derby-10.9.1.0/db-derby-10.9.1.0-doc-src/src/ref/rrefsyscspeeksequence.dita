<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_PEEK_AT_SEQUENCE system function</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_PEEK_AT_SEQUENCE</codeph> function
allows users to observe the instantaneous current value of a sequence generator
without having to query the
<xref href="rrefsistabssyssequences.dita#rrefsistabssyssequences"></xref>.
Querying the SYSSEQUENCES table does not actually return the current value; it
only returns an upper bound on that value, that is, the end of the chunk of
sequence values which has been preallocated but not actually used. The
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_PEEK_AT_SEQUENCE</codeph> function shows you the very
next value which will be returned by a NEXT VALUE FOR clause. Users should never
directly query the SYSSEQUENCES table, because that will cause sequence
generator concurrency to slow drastically.</p></section>
