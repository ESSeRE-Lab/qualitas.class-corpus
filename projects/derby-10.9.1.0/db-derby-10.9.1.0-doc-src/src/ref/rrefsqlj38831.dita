<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS system procedure</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS()</codeph> system
procedure turns a connection's runtime statistics on or off. By default, the
runtime statistics are turned off. When the <codeph>runtimestatistics</codeph> attribute
is turned on, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> maintains
information about the execution plan for each statement executed within the
connection (except for COMMIT) until the attribute is turned off.  To turn
the <codeph>runtimestatistics</codeph> attribute off, call the procedure with
an argument of zero. To turn the <codeph>runtimestatistics</codeph> on, call
the procedure with any non-zero argument.</p></section>
<section><p>For statements that do not return rows, the object is created
when all internal processing has completed before returning to the client
program. For statements that return rows, the object is created when the first <codeph>next()</codeph> call
returns 0 rows or if a <codeph>close()</codeph> call is encountered, whichever
comes first.</p></section>
