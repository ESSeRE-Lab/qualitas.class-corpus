<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_MODE system procedure</title>
<refbody>
    <section><p>When runtime statistics are being captured, you can control
            the mode of processing using this procedure. When the xplain mode
            is set to 1, statements are compiled and optimized, but not
            executed; when the xplain mode is set to 0 (the default), statements
            are compiled, optimized, and executed normally.</p>
        <p>Note that xplain_mode only matters when xplain style has been
            enabled, see the
<xref href="rref_syscs_set_xplain_schema.dita#rref_syscs_set_xplain_schema">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA</xref> system
procedure for more information.</p>

<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this procedure by default. See "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information. The
database owner can grant access to other users.</p>
