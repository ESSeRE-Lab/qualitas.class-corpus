    <section><p>See "Working with RunTimeStatistics" in

        <p>
            Each row in this table describes a single statement which has
            been captured. Depending on the precise configuration of the
            RUNTIMESTATISTICS and XPLAIN features, there may be additional
            rows in the other XPLAIN system tables with additional information;
            the STMT_ID and TIMING_ID columns in this table are used to join
            against those tables.</p><p>Rows in this table are added
            automatically when 
            <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
            has been configured appropriately. The
            rows remain in the table until you delete them or drop the table.
                </p>
