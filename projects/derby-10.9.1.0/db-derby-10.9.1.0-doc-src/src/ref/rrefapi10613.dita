<title>Derby API</title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides
Javadoc HTML files of API classes and interfaces in the <i>javadoc</i> subdirectory.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>This appendix provides a brief overview of the API. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does
not provide the Javadoc for the <i>java.sql</i> packages, the main API for
working with <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>, because
it is included in the JDBC API. For information about <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>'s
implementation of JDBC, see <xref href="crefjdbc12657.dita#crefjdbc12657"></xref>.</p></section>
<section><p>This document divides the API classes and interfaces into several
categories.   The stand-alone tools and utilities are java classes that stand
on their own and are invoked in a command window. The JDBC implementation
classes are standard JDBC APIs, and are not invoked on the command-line. Instead,
you invoke these only within a specified context within another application.</p></section>
