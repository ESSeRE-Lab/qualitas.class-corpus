<section><title>Statement dependency system</title> <p>Any statements
referencing the view are invalidated on a DROP VIEW statement. DROP VIEW is
disallowed if there are any views or open cursors dependent on the view.</p>
<p>Normally, you must drop a view before you drop any objects that the view
depends on. However, if you issue an ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN command with the
CASCADE option, any views that depend on the column will be dropped. Also, if
you use a REVOKE statement to revoke privileges on objects that a view depends
on, the view will be dropped. Similarly, if you use a DROP ROLE statement to
drop a role that has privileges on objects that a view depends on, the view will
be dropped.</p>
