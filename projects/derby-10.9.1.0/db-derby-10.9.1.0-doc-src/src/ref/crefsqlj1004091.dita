<title>Qualifying dictionary objects</title>
<conbody>
<p>Since some dictionary objects can be contained within other objects, you
can qualify those dictionary object names. Each component is separated from
the next by a period. An <i>SQL92Identifier</i> is "dot-separated." You qualify
a dictionary object name in order to avoid ambiguity.</p>
