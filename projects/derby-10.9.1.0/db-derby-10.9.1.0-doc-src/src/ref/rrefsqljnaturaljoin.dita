<p>
A NATURAL JOIN is a <xref href="rrefsqlj29840.dita#rrefsqlj29840">
JOIN operation</xref> that creates an implicit join clause for you
based on the common columns in the two tables being joined. Common
columns are columns that have the same name in both tables.
</p>

<p>
A NATURAL JOIN can be an INNER join, a LEFT OUTER join, or a RIGHT
OUTER join. The default is INNER join.
</p>

<p>
If the SELECT statement in which the NATURAL JOIN operation appears
has an asterisk (*) in the select list, the asterisk will be expanded
to the following list of columns (in this order):
</p>

<ul>
<li>All the common columns</li>
<li>Every column in the first (left) table that is not a common column</li>
<li>Every column in the second (right) table that is not a common column</li>
</ul>

<p>
An asterisk qualified by a table name (for example, COUNTRIES.*) will
be expanded to every column of that table that is not a common column.
</p>

<p>
If a common column is referenced without being qualified by a table
name, the column reference points to the column in the first (left)
table if the join is an INNER JOIN or a LEFT OUTER JOIN. If it is a
RIGHT OUTER JOIN, unqualified references to a common column point to
the column in the second (right) table.
</p>

<title>Syntax</title>
<codeblock><b><i><xref href="rreftableexpression.dita#rreftableexpression">TableExpression</xref></i> NATURAL [ { LEFT | RIGHT } [ OUTER ] | INNER ] JOIN { <xref href="rrefsqlj33215.dita#rrefsqlj33215">TableViewOrFunctionExpression</xref> | ( <i><xref href="rreftableexpression.dita#rreftableexpression">TableExpression</xref></i> ) }</b></codeblock>

<example>
<title>Examples</title>

<p>
If the tables COUNTRIES and CITIES have two common columns named
COUNTRY and COUNTRY_ISO_CODE, the following two SELECT statements are
equivalent:
</p>

<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES NATURAL JOIN CITIES</b></codeblock>

<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES JOIN CITIES
    USING (COUNTRY, COUNTRY_ISO_CODE)</b></codeblock>

<p>
The following example is similar to the one above, but it also
preserves unmatched rows from the first (left) table:
</p>

<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES NATURAL LEFT JOIN CITIES</b></codeblock>

</example>
