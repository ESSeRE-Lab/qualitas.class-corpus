optionally creates database tables to hold statistics
information captured using XPLAIN style. You can have zero, one, or many
sets of these tables; each set of tables is stored in a separate
schema. The schema which is used for capturing statement execution
information is specified using the

system procedure</p></section>
<section><p>You can query these tables to analyze the behavior of
statement execution.</p></section>
<section><p>All of the above system tables reside in the schema which
you specified. Because this
is not the default schema, qualify all queries accessing the system tables
with the schema name.</p></section>
<section><p>You can create the schema and tables ahead of time if you wish,
        but usually it is easier to let 
        <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
        automatically create the schema and
the tables for you. You can capture multiple sets of data into the same
tables, or you can specify a different schema each time.</p>
