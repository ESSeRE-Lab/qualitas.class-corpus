<section><p>If you connect to a read-only database, the appropriate <i>isReadOnly
DatabaseMetaData</i> value is returned. For example, <i>Connections</i> set
to read-only using the <i>setReadOnly</i> method, <i>Connections</i> for which
the user has been defined as a <i>readOnlyAccess</i> user (with one of the <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> properties), and <i>Connections</i> to
databases on read-only media return true.</p></section>
