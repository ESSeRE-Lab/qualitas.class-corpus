<section><title>Function</title>
<p>If set to true, enables row-level locking. When you disable row-level
locking, you use table-level locking.</p>
<p>Row-level locking uses more system resources but allows greater concurrency,
which works better in multi-user systems. Table-level locking works best with
single-user applications or read-only applications.</p>
<p>If you use row-level locking (the default), the system decides whether to
use table-level locking or row-level locking for each table in each DML
statement. In certain situations, the system might choose to escalate the
locking scheme from row-level locking to table-level locking to improve
performance.</p>
<p>For more information about locking, see "Locking and performance"
in <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/cittuning"></ph>, and
"Locking, concurrency, and isolation" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
