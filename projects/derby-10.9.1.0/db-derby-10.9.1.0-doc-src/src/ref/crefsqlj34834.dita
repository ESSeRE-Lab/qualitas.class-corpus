<title>SQL92Identifier</title>
<conbody>
<p>An <i>SQL92Identifier</i> is a dictionary object identifier that conforms
to the rules of SQL-92. SQL-92 states that identifiers for dictionary objects
are limited to 128 characters and are case-insensitive (unless delimited by
double quotes), because they are automatically translated into uppercase by
the system. You cannot use reserved words as identifiers for dictionary objects
unless they are delimited. If you attempt to use a name longer than 128 characters, <i>SQLException</i> X0X11
is raised.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> defines keywords
beyond those specified by the SQL-92 standard (see <xref href="rrefkeywords29722.dita#rrefkeywords29722"></xref>).</p>

<ph>-- the view name is stored in the system
-- catalogs with case intact</ph>
