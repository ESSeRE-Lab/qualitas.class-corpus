<title>Built-in functions</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>A built-in function is an expression in which an SQL keyword or
special operator executes some operation. Built-in functions use keywords
or special built-in operators. Built-ins are SQL92Identifiers and are case-insensitive.
Note that escaped functions like TIMESTAMPADD and TIMESTAMPDIFF are only accessible
using the JDBC escape function syntax, and can be found in <xref href="rrefjdbc1020262.dita#rrefjdbc1020262"></xref>.</p></section>
