<refbody>
<section><p>The CALL (PROCEDURE) statement is used to call procedures. A call to a
procedure does not return any value.</p>
<p>When a procedure with definer's rights is called, the current default schema
is set to the eponymously named schema of the definer. For example, if the
defining user is called OWNER, the default schema will also be set to OWNER.
The definer's rights include the right to set the current role to a role
for which the definer has privileges. When the procedure is first invoked, no
role is set; even if the invoker has set a current role, the procedure running
with definer's rights has no current role set initially.</p>
<p>When a procedure with invoker's rights is called, the current default
schema and current role are unchanged initially within the procedure. Similarly,
if SQL authorization mode is not enabled, the current default schema is
unchanged initially within the procedure.</p>
<p>When the call returns, any changes made inside the procedure to the default
current schema (and current role, if relevant) are reset (popped).</p>
