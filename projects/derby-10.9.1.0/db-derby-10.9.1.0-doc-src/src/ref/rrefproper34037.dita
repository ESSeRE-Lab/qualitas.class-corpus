<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Defines the location on disk for temporary file space needed by
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> for performing large
sorts and deferred deletes and updates. (Temporary files are automatically
deleted after use, and are removed when the database restarts after a crash.)
The temporary directory named by this property will be created if it does not
exist, but will not be deleted when the system shuts down. The path name
specified by this property must have file separators that are appropriate to the
current operating system.</p>
<p>This property allows databases located on read-only media to write temporary
files to a writable location. If this property is not set, databases located
on read-only media might get an error like the following:</p>
<codeblock>ERROR XSDF1: Exception during creation 
	of file  c:\databases\db\tmp\T887256591756.tmp
for container
ERROR XJ001: Java exception:
'a:\databases\db\tmp\T887256591756.tmp: java.io.IOException'.</codeblock>
<p>This property moves the temporary directories for all databases being used
by the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system.
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> makes temporary
directories for each database under the directory referenced by this property.
For example, if the property is set as follows:</p>
<codeblock><b>derby.storage.tempDirectory=C:/Temp/dbtemp</b></codeblock>
<p>the temporary directories for the databases in <i>C:\databases\db1</i> and
<i>C:\databases\db2</i> will be in <i>C:\Temp\dbtemp\db1</i> and
<i>C:\Temp\dbtemp\db2</i>, respectively.</p>
<p>The temporary files of two databases running concurrently with the same name
(for example, <i>C:\databases\db1</i> and <i>E:\databases\db1</i>) will
conflict with each other if the <i>derby.storage.tempDirectory</i> property is
set. This will cause incorrect results, so users are advised to give databases
unique names.</p>
</section>
<section><title>Default</title>
<p>A subdirectory named <i>tmp</i> under the database directory.</p>
<p>For example, if the database <i>db1</i> is stored in <i>C:\databases\db1</i>,
the temporary files are created in <i>C:\databases\db1\tmp</i>.</p>

effect.</p>
