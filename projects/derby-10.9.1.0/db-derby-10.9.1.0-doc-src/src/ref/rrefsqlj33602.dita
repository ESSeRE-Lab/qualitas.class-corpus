<section> <p>A WHERE clause is an optional part of a <i><xref href="rrefselectexpression.dita#rrefselectexpression">SelectExpression</xref>,</i> <xref
href="rrefsqlj35981.dita#rrefsqlj35981">DELETE statement</xref>, or <xref href="rrefsqlj26498.dita#rrefsqlj26498">UPDATE statement</xref>.
The WHERE clause lets you select rows based on a boolean expression. Only
rows for which the expression evaluates to TRUE are returned in the result,
or, in the case of a DELETE statement, deleted, or, in the case of an UPDATE
statement, updated.</p></section>
