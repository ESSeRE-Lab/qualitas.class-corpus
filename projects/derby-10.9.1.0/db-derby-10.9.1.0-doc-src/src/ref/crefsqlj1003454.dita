<title>Rules for SQL92 identifiers</title>

<conbody>
<p>Ordinary identifiers are identifiers not surrounded by double quotation
marks. Delimited identifiers are identifiers surrounded by double quotation
marks.</p>
<p>An ordinary identifier must begin with a letter and contain only letters,
underscore characters (_), and digits. The permitted letters and digits include
all Unicode letters and digits, but <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does
not attempt to ensure that the characters in identifiers are valid in the
database's locale. </p>
<p><indexterm>delimited identifiers<indexterm>definition</indexterm></indexterm>A
delimited identifier can contain any characters within the double quotation
marks. The enclosing double quotation marks are not part of the identifier;
they serve only to mark its beginning and end. Spaces at the end of a delimited
identifier are insignificant (truncated). <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> translates
two consecutive double quotation marks within a delimited identifier as one
double quotation mark-that is, the "translated" double quotation mark becomes
a character in the delimited identifier.</p>
<p>Periods within delimited identifiers are not separators but are part of
the identifier (the name of the dictionary object being represented).</p>
<p>So, in the following example:   <codeblock><b>"A.B"</b></codeblock></p>
<p>is a dictionary object, while   <codeblock><b>"A"."B"</b></codeblock></p>
<p>is a dictionary object qualified by another dictionary object (such as
a column named "B" within the table "A").</p>
