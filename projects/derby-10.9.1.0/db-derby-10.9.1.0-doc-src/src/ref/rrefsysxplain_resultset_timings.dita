<title>SYSXPLAIN_RESULTSET_TIMINGS system table</title>
<shortdesc>The SYSXPLAIN_RESULTSET_TIMINGS table captures timing information
about result set accesses which occurred during statements that were executed
using RUNTIMESTATISTICS with XPLAIN style.</shortdesc>

    <section><p>See "Working with RunTimeStatistics" in
         <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/cittuning"></ph> for information
         on how to configure this.
            Note that statistics timing must be configured by calling
            SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_STATISTICS_TIMING(1).
            Each row in this table describes various timing information
            for this particular result set in this particular statement.
            Rows in this table are typically joined with rows in
            SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS and SYSXPLAIN_RESULTSETS during analysis.
        For example:</p>
<codeblock>select rs.op_identifier, rst.execute_time
    from my_stats.sysxplain_resultsets rs,
         my_stats.sysxplain_resultset_timings rst
    where rs.stmt_id = ? and
          rs.timing_id = rst.timing_id
    order by rst.execute_time desc</codeblock>
            <p>Rows in this table are added
            automatically when 
            <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
            has been configured appropriately. The
            rows remain in the table until you delete them or drop the table.
                </p>

system table.</p>
