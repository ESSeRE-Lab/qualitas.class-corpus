<p>
The USING clause specifies which columns to test for equality when two
tables are joined. It can be used instead of an ON clause in the
<xref href="rrefsqlj29840.dita#rrefsqlj29840">JOIN operations</xref>
that have an explicit join clause.
</p>

<title>Syntax</title>

<codeblock><b>USING ( <i><xref href="rrefsimplecolumnname.dita#rrefsimplecolumnname">Simple-column-Name</xref></i> [ , <i><xref href="rrefsimplecolumnname.dita#rrefsimplecolumnname">Simple-column-Name</xref></i> ]* )</b></codeblock>

<p>
The columns listed in the USING clause must be present in both of the
two tables being joined. The USING clause will be transformed to an ON
clause that checks for equality between the named columns in the two
tables.
</p>

<p>
When a USING clause is specified, an asterisk (*) in the select list
of the query will be expanded to the following list of columns (in
this order):
</p>

<ul>
<li>All the columns in the USING clause</li>
<li>All the columns of the first (left) table that are not specified
in the USING clause</li>
<li>All the columns of the second (right) table that are not specified
in the USING clause</li>
</ul>

<p>
An asterisk qualified by a table name (for example, COUNTRIES.*) will
be expanded to every column of that table that is not listed in the
USING clause.
</p>

<p>
If a column in the USING clause is referenced without being qualified
by a table name, the column reference points to the column in the
first (left) table if the join is an INNER JOIN or a LEFT OUTER
JOIN. If it is a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, unqualified references to a column
in the USING clause point to the column in the second (right) table.
</p>

</refsyn>

<example>
<title>Examples</title>

<p>
The following query performs an inner join between the COUNTRIES table
and the CITIES table on the condition that COUNTRIES.COUNTRY is equal
to CITIES.COUNTRY:
</p>

<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES JOIN CITIES
     USING (COUNTRY)</b></codeblock>

<p>
The next query is similar to the one above, but it has the additional
join condition that COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE is equal to
CITIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE:
</p>

<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES JOIN CITIES
    USING (COUNTRY, COUNTRY_ISO_CODE)</b></codeblock>

</example>
