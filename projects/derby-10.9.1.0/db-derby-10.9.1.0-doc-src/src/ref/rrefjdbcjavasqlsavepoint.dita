<section><p>The <i>Savepoint</i> interface contains
methods to set, release, or roll back a transaction to designated savepoints.
Once a savepoint has been set, the transaction can be rolled back to that
savepoint without affecting preceding work. Savepoints provide finer-grained
control of transactions by marking intermediate points within a transaction.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does not support
savepoints within a trigger.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does not release
locks as part of the rollback to savepoint.</p>
<p>For more information on using savepoints, see the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p></section>
