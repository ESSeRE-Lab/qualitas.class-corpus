<section> <p>When used outside stored routines, SESSION_USER,
<xref href="rrefsqlj42476.dita#rrefsqlj42476">USER</xref>, and 
<xref href="rrefsqlj42324.dita#rrefsqlj42324">CURRENT_USER</xref> all
return the authorization identifier of the user that created the SQL
session.</p>
<p>SESSION_USER also always returns this value when used within stored
routines.</p>
<p>If used within a stored routine created with EXTERNAL SECURITY DEFINER,
however, USER and CURRENT_USER return the authorization identifier of the user
that owns the schema of the routine. This is usually the creating user,
although the database owner could be the creator as well.</p>
