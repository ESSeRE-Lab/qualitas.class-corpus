<section><title>Function</title>
<p>Causes a detailed list of locks at the time of a deadlock or a timeout
to be written to the error log (typically the file <i>derby.log</i>). For a
deadlock, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> describes the
cycle of locks which caused the deadlock. For a timeout,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> prints the entire lock
list at the time of the timeout. This property is meaningful only if the
<i><xref href="rrefproper98166.dita#rrefproper98166">derby.locks.monitor</xref></i>
property is set to <i>true</i>.</p>
<note>This level of debugging is intrusive: it can alter
the timing of the application, reduce performance severely, and produce a
large error log file. It should be used with care.</note>
