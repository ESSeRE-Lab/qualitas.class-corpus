<title>SQL identifiers </title>

<p><indexterm>SQL identifiers<indexterm>definition</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Identifiers<indexterm>definition</indexterm></indexterm>An <i
>identifier</i> is the representation within the language of items created
by the user, as opposed to language keywords or commands.  <indexterm>Dictionary
objects<indexterm>definition</indexterm></indexterm>Some identifiers stand
for <i>dictionary objects</i>, which are the objects you create- such as tables,
views, indexes, columns, and constraints- that are stored in a database. They
are called dictionary objects because <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> stores
information about them in the system tables, sometimes known as a data dictionary.
SQL also defines ways to alias these objects within certain statements.</p>

>Each kind of identifier must conform to a different set of rules. Identifiers
representing dictionary objects must conform to SQL-92 identifier rules and
are thus called <i><xref href="crefsqlj34834.dita#crefsqlj34834">SQL92Identifier</xref>s</i>.</p>
