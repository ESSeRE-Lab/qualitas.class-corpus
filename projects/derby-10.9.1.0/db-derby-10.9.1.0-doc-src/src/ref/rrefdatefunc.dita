<refbody>
<section> <p>The argument must be a date, timestamp, a positive number less
than or equal to 2,932,897, a valid string representation of a date or timestamp,
or a string of length 7 that is not a CLOB, LONG VARCHAR, or XML value. If
the argument is a string of length 7, it must represent a valid date in the
form yyyynnn, where yyyy are digits denoting a year, and nnn are digits between
001 and 366, denoting a day of that year.  The result of the function is a
date. If the argument can be null, the result can be null; if the argument
is null, the result is the null value. </p> <p>The other rules depend on the
data type of the argument specified:  <ul>
<li>If the argument is a date, timestamp, or valid string representation of
a date or timestamp: The result is the date part of the value.</li>
<li>If the argument is a number: The result is the date that is n-1 days after
January 1, 1970, where n is the integral part of the number.</li>
<li>If the argument is a string with a length of 7: The result is the date
represented by the string.</li>
