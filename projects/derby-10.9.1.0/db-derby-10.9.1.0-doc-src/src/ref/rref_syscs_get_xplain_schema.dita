<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA system function</title>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA</codeph> function
        returns the xplain schema for the connection.</p>
    <p>The default xplain schema is empty,
        so if the xplain style hasn't been set, the function returns the
        empty string.
        If the xplain schema has been set using
        <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA</codeph>, the function
        returns the xplain schema that was set. If xplain schema is set to
        a non-empty value, and runtime statistics are being captured, then
        the runtime statistics will be stored into the SYSXPLAIN_* database
        tables in that schema for later analysis.</p>
    <p>
            See "Working with RunTimeStatistics" in the 
            <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/cittuning"></ph>
            for additional information.

<section><title>Execute privileges</title>
<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this function by default. See "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information. The
database owner can grant access to other users.</p>

    <p>To determine the current value of the XPLAIN schema:</p>

        values syscs_util.syscs_get_xplain_schema();
</codeblock></section>
