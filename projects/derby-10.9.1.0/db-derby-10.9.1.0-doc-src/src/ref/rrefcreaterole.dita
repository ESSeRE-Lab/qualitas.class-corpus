<p>The CREATE ROLE statement allows you to create an SQL role.</p>
<p>Only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> can
create a role.</p>
<p>For more information on roles, see "Using SQL roles" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph>.</p>
</section>

<codeblock>
<b>CREATE ROLE <i><xref href="rrefrolename.dita#rrefrolename">roleName</xref></i>
</b></codeblock>
</refsyn>
<section>
<p>Before you issue a CREATE ROLE statement, verify that the
<i><xref href="rrefpropersqlauth.dita#rrefpropersqlauth">derby.database.sqlAuthorization</xref></i>
property is set to <codeph>TRUE</codeph>. The
<i>derby.database.sqlAuthorization</i> property enables SQL authorization mode.
</p>
<p>You cannot create a role name if there is a user by that name. An attempt
to create a role name that conflicts with an existing user name raises the
<i>SQLException</i> X0Y68.</p>
<p>If user names are not controlled by the database owner (or administrator),
it may be a good idea to use a naming convention for roles to reduce the
possibility of collision with user names.</p>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> tries to avoid name
collision between user names and role names, but this is not always possible,
because <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> has a
pluggable authorization architecture. For example, an externally defined user
may exist who has never yet connected to the database, created any schema
objects, or been granted any privileges. If 
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> knows about a user
name, it will forbid creating a role with that name.  Correspondingly, a user
who has the same name as a role will not be allowed to connect.
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> built-in users are
checked for collision when a role is created.</p>
<p>A role name cannot start with the prefix SYS (after case normalization). The
purpose of this restriction is to reserve a name space for system-defined roles
at a later point. Use of the prefix SYS raises the <i>SQLException</i> 4293A.
</p>
<p>You cannot create a role with the name <codeph>PUBLIC</codeph> (after case
normalization). <codeph>PUBLIC</codeph> is a reserved authorization identifier.
An attempt to create a role with the name <codeph>PUBLIC</codeph> raises
<i>SQLException</i> 4251B.</p>
