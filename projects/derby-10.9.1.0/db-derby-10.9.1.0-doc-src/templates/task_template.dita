<!--TASK ID: When you use this template to create a new task topic, 
you must edit the task id and change "task_template" to whatever the topic
filename is.  For example, if the topic filename is treftask.dita, 
then the task id should be  
task id="treftask"  
instead of 
task id="task_template"-->
<task id="task_template" xml:lang="en-us">
<!--TOPIC TITLE:  Clearly and succinctly identify the task. 
Begin the title with the gerund (the -ing form) of a specific verb, such as 
Subscribing, and maintain a verb-object structure. Avoid nonspecific verbs like 
"Using" or "Working with".
For example: Encrypting databases with a new external encryption key
Capitalize only the first word of a title, except for proper nouns within it.-->
<title>task_template</title>
<!--SHORT DESCRIPTION: The short description is used for the first paragraph in the 
topic and as an abstract. Short descriptions can be 1-3 sentences long.-->

<!--INDEX ENTRIES: Below is the tagging needed for index entries.  To add an 
index entry, insert the <indexterm> tag inside the <keywords> tag.
See the Derby Documentation page for guidelines on indexing a topic. -->

<!--PREREQUISITES: If there are prerequisites that the user must complete 
BEFORE performing this task, add the prerequisites in the <prereq> section.  
This tag is optional. -->

<!--CONTEXT: If there is additional introductory information for this task that 
the short description does not cover, type it in the <context> section. -->

<!--STEPS: The tags that you use for the steps depend on what you are asking 
the user to do. 
REQUIRED TAGS: You must use the <steps> <step> and <cmd> tags.  
OPTIONAL TAGS: You can use other tags within the <steps> tag to help structure the steps, 
such as <stepresult> <choices> <substeps> and <choicetable>-->
<steps>
<step><cmd>Do this</cmd>
<!--Use <stepresult> if you need to indicate to the user the result of a step.
For example, if something specific displays back to the user that is helpful. -->

<step><cmd>Then this</cmd>
<!--Use <choices> for a bulleted list of options on a single step.-->
<choices>
<choice>Using this method</choice>
<choice>Or this method</choice>
</choices>
</step>
<step><cmd>Then this</cmd>
<!--Use <substeps> when there are distinct parts to a step. It is often helpful 
to have an example. Use the <stepxmp> tag and the <codeblock> tag for examples. 
Do NOT bold the text inside the codeblock.-->
<substeps>
<substep><cmd>which is done by doing this</cmd></substep>
<substep><cmd>and then this.</cmd><stepxmp>For example:  <codeblock>CREATE TABLE <varname>tablename</varname>

<!--RESULT: Use the <result> tag when you want to provide the user with a result for 
the overall task.  You can use the <stepresult> tag if you need to let the user know about 
something before they proceed to the next step. This tag is optional. -->
<result></result>
<!--EXAMPLE: Use the <example> tag when you want to provide an example for the 
entire task. It is better to add short examples within the steps (see substep b) 
instead of using this tag.  This tag is optional. 
Alternatively, you can create a reference topic for the example.
Use a reference topic for your example if your example is really long.

<!--POSTREQ: Use the <postreq> tag when you want to describe to the user what 
they can do after they complete this task.  This tag is optional. -->
