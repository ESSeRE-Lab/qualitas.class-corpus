<!-- 
This is the grammar which defines the structure of messages.xml.
That file, in turn, is the source code used to generate the following
additional files when Derby is built:

 * English messages for Derby
 * the English Reference Guide page which describes Derby SQLStates.

Elements of the grammar have the following meanings:

 * section - Used to group messages for inclusion (or not) in the Reference Guide.
 * title - Used as table header in the Reference Guide.
 * desc - Internal description of a section.
 * documented - If this element is specified, then the section's messages turn up in the Reference Guide.
 * name - Runtime handle, also the SQLState printed in the Reference Guide.
 * text - Text of message with possible placeholders for arguments.
 * arg - Human-readable argument name interpolated into message text in the Reference Guide.
