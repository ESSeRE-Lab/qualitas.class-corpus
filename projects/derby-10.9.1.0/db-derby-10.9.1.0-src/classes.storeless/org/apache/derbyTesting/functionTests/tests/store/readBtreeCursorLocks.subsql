-- Very basic single user testing of read locks on cursors on indexes.
-- This ".subsql" test is
-- meant to be run from another test such that it gets run under multiple
-- isolation levels.  This is important as they behave
-- differently, depending on isolation levels.
--
-- assume's caller has already done: run 'LockTableQuery.subsql'; to get 
-- easy access to the lock VTI.
