# This is the default system properties file for SQL and JAVA tests.
#
# *** DO NOT PUT PROPERTIES FOR THE DERBY SYSTEM IN THIS FILE.  
# *** THEY BELONG IN default_derby.properties.
#
# This file will get handed to the test on the command line in a -p <filename>
# argument.
#
# This causes ij to load the driver and make an
# initial connection to the database.
#
# The .java test has to call util.getPropertyArg and util.startJBMS
# to process the property file.  See any of the .java tests for this code.
#
# If you want to alter these to use a different driver, connect to a different
# database, or to not be used, override this file by creating
# a file <testname>_app.properties to be used instead of this file.
