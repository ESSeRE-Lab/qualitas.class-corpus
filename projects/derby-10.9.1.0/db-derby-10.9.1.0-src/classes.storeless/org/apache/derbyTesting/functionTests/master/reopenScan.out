-- Test reopening scans.  A in subquery generates
-- a lot of reopen requests to the underlying scan.
-- We are used to having to reopen something like a
-- base table scan, but we need to be careful reopening
-- things like join nodes.  This test is to ensure
-- that we don't leave around any state when reopening
-- various complex nodes.
