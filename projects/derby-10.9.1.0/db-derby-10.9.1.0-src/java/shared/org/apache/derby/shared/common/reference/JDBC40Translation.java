/**
        This class contains public statics that map directly to the
        new public statics in the jdbc 4.0 interfaces.  By providing
        an intermediary class with hard-coded copies of constants that
        will be available in jdbc 4.0, it becomes possible to refer to
        these constants when compiling against older jdk versions.

        <P>The test <code>jdbc4/JDBC40TranslationTest.junit</code>,
        which is compiled against jdk16, contains tests that verifies
        that these hard coded constants are in fact equal to those
        found in jdk16.

        <P>
        This class should not be shipped with the product.

        <P>
        This class has no methods, all it contains are constants
        are public, static and final since they are declared in an interface.
