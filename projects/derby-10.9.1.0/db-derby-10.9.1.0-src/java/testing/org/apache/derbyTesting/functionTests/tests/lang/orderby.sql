-- Some test cases for DERBY-2351. The issue in DERBY-2351 involves whether
-- pulled-up ORDER BY columns appear in the result set or not, and how
-- DISCTINCT interacts with that decision. The point is that DISTINCT should
-- apply only to the columns specified by the user in the result column list,
-- not to the extra columns pulled up into the result by the ORDER BY. This
-- means that some queries should throw an error, but due to DERBY-2351
-- the queries instead display erroneous results.

select distinct c1, c2 from t1 order by c1;
-- This statement is legitimate. Even though c1+1 is not distinct, c1 is:
select distinct c1, c2 from t1 order by c1+1;
-- DERBY-2351 causes this statement to return 4 rows, which it should
-- instead show an error. Note that the rows returned are not distinct!
select distinct c2 from t1 order by c1;
-- This query should return 3 distinct rows, ordered by column c2
select distinct c2 from t1 order by c2;
-- This query should work because * will be expanded to include c2:
select distinct * from t1 order by c2;
-- After the * is expanded, the query contains c1, so this is legitimate:
select distinct * from t1 order by c1+1;
-- This query also should not work because the order by col is not in result:
select distinct t1.* from t1, t2 where t1.c1=t2.t2c1 order by t2c1;
-- But without the distinct it should be fine:
select t1.* from t1, t2 where t1.c1=t2.t2c1 order by t2c1;
