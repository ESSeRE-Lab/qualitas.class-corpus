Running replication tests
*************************

cd <testing dir>/ # ${user.dir}

java  -Djava.security.policy="<NONE>" \
      junit.textui.TestRunner \
          org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.replicationTests.ReplicationRun

which runs (*the only test* - the "test framework") ReplicationRun.testReplication.
See README.testReplication for a description.


ReplicationRun.testReplication relies on '${user.dir}/replicationtest.properties'
to find 
- master and slave jar files (special Derby code variants in the Proof of Concept code)
- test and test verification code to be run (the actual test...)
- master and slave server hostnames and portnumbers
- test client host names
- load client hostnames
- ..
- .
See README.properties for a description of properties used by 
org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.replicationTests.ReplicationRun 
and tests.
