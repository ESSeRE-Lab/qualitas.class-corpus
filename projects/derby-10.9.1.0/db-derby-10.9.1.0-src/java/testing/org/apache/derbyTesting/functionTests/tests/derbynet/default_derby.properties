# This is the default derby properties file for SQL and JAVA tests.
#
# *** DO NOT PUT PROPERTIES FOR THE JAVA ENVIRONMENT IN THIS FILE.  
# *** THEY BELONG IN default_app.properties.

# This file will get renamed to be derby.properties for all
# tests without a <testname>_derby.properties file defined.
#
# If you want to alter these to use other settings, 
# or to not be used, override this file by creating
# a file <testname>_derby.properties to be used instead of this file.
#

# statement cache size of 20 is the default, do not add this property
# to this file.  If your test wants to do consistency checking that
# requires an empty cache, add a special test_derby.properties file, see
# inbetween_derby.properties for an example.
