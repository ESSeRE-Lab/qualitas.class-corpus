This directory contains scripts to generate a test class for 
testing whether we are correctly creating internationalized messages.
This is the only real way we can catch misuses of message formatting,
such as using a message id that has no matching message or using
the incorrect number of parameters for the message.

This script should be run by a user who (a) has access to /bin/sh
and sed and (b) wants to verify the validity of our internationalized 
messages.  You should run this *BEFORE* you do a build, as it generates
a test source file that should then be compiled.

It is generally expected that this be done as part of nightly regression
and release tests on one or more platforms that support /bin/sh.  This
test should be run with the sane build as it makes use of ASSERTs within the
internationalization framework.

Files in this directory
=======================
generateClientMessageTest.sh
  This file is a shell script used to generate a test class for
  client messages.  The file generated is 
  functionTests/tests/i18n/TestClientMessages.java

  This test is basically a copy of each construction of SqlException
  that uses the MessageId class.  These copies are cleaned up so they
  can be run out of context, and then sanity code in the message
  construction utility class makes sure that the message id has a
  matching message string available to the client and that the right
  number of parameters are being used.

genClient1.sed
  A sed script used by generateClientMessageTest.sh to create the 
  test file

genClient2.sed
  A sed script used by generateClientMessageTest.sh to create the 
  test file
