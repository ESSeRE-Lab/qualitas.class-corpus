This directory contains project files for NetBeans.

To use, simply choose File->Open Project in NetBeans, and browse to
the appropriate folder for the version of NetBeans you are using.

If you want to copy the project file to a different location, copy
the nbproject directory.   Then, edit nbproject/project.xml, and change
project.dir to be the correct *relative* path to the root of the Derby
tree.

The project folder does *not* contain user-specific settings. Those
are stored in the user directory (e.g. ~/.netbeans) and in nbproject/private,
which is not checked in.
