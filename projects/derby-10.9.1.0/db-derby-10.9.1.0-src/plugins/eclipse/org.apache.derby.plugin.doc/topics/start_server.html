<title>Starting the Derby Network Server</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Starting the Derby Network Server</h2>
<p>
The Derby Network Server allows multiple applications running in different
Java Virtual Machines to access a single Derby database.  
Once the Network Server is started client applications from within Eclipse, 
such as <b>ij</b> or other Java applications, can access a Derby database.  
Additionally, the Network Server allows for client applications outside 
of Eclipse on the localhost, or even on remote hosts to access the same 
database.
</p>
<p>
<h3>To start the Derby Network Server:</h3>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The Derby nature needs to be added to the project prior to starting the Network Server.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
With the Java project selected, bring up the context menu and select 
the menu item, <b>Apache Derby, Start Derby Network Server</b>.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The pop-up box will appear which states the Apache Derby Network Server is
attempting to be started.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
If the network server startup is successful the <b>Console</b> view will
display <b>Server is ready to accept connections on port xxxx.</b>
  For each project that has a running Network Server associated with it 
a green arrow appears next to the project name. 
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="images/start_server_console.gif" alt="Network Server started" width="746" height="577"></img> 
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
If other items that use the console as a display hide the Network Server
console use the <b>Display Selected Console</b> drop down icon to the right 
of the console menu bar to make the Network Server console visible.
</li>
</ul>
</p> 

<h3>Derby Network Server Host value</h3>
<p>
By starting the Derby Network Server using the default values the 
server runs on the localhost, which is the host running Eclipse, 
on port 1527.  To change the host name or the port number where the Derby 
Network Server is running see <a href="properties.html"> Setting Derby properties for a project</a>.
</p>
<p>
The value used for the Network Server host name impacts the ability of 
remote hosts to connect to the Network Server.  If the Network Server Host value
in the Project Properties is set to <b>localhost</b>, only clients running
on the host where Eclipse is running can connect to the network server.
If an ip address or hostname (other than the name 'localhost') is used, 
client applications running on other hosts can connect to the Derby Network
Server.  For additional information about starting the Derby Network Server
see the Derby Server and Administration Guide.  The section
called <b>Starting the Network Server</b> explains the effect of setting
the value for the hostname differently.
</p>
<p>
If connections from other hosts will be allowed, it is recommended to run
under the Java security manager and enable user authentication prior to
starting the Derby Network Server.
