<title>Setting Derby properties for a project</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Setting Derby properties for a project</h2>
<p>
Properties relating to Apache Derby can be specified for any project 
which has had the Apache Derby nature added to it.  The two categories
of properties available to change are the Network Server and Derby System
properties.
</p>
<p>
<b>Network Server Properties</b>
</p>
<p>
By starting the Derby Network Server using the default values the 
server runs on the localhost, which is the host running Eclipse, 
on port 1527. 
</p>
<p>
The value used for the Network Server host name impacts the ability of 
remote hosts to connect to the Network Server.  If the Network Server 
Host value in the Apache Derby Properties for the project is set to 
<b>localhost</b>, only clients running on the host where Eclipse is 
running can connect to the network server.  If an ip address or hostname 
(other than the name 'localhost')
is used, client applications running on other hosts can connect to the 
Derby Network Server.  For additional information about starting the Derby 
Network Server see the <i>Derby Server and Administration Guide</i>.  
The section called <b>Starting the Network Server</b> explains the effect 
of setting the value for the hostname differently.
</p>
<p>
If connections from other hosts is allowed, it is recommended to run
under the Java security manager and enable user authentication prior to
starting the Derby Network Server.
</p>
<b>Network Server Settings</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Network Server Port - default value of 1527<br/><br/>
Valid values for this field are:
<ul>
<li>
Any port number not currently used by another process to listen on
<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Network Server Host - default value of localhost <br/><br/>
Valid values for this field are:
<ul>
<li>
localhost
</li>
<li>
The ip address of the host running Eclipse
</li>
<li>
The host name of the host running Eclipse
</li>
<li>
The ip address of 0.0.0.0 (to listen on all interfaces)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<b>Derby System Properties</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>derby.system.home</b> refers to the file system directory where the
Derby database system will look for databases when Derby is started. 
Setting this property allows for ease of use when specifiying a JDBC 
connection URL to a Derby database which is not in the current directory. 
For additional information on <b>derby.system.home</b> refer to the <i>Tuning Derby</i> guide.
</p>
<p>
<b>Derby System Property values</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
derby.system.home - default value of '.', the current project directory<br/><br/>
Valid values for this field are:
<ul>
<li>A directory path on the local host. Either an existing directory or a new
one which has not yet been created. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Changing the default Apache Derby properties for a project</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
With the Java project active in the <b>Package Explorer</b> or <b>Navigator</b>
view, select the menu item <b>Project, Properties</b>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
