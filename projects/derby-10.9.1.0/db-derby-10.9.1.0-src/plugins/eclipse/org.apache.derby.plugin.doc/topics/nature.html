the menu item, <b>Apache Derby, Add Apache Derby nature</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Adding the Derby nature to your Java project does the following:
<ul>
<li>
Adds the <b>derby.jar, derbynet.jar, derbytools.jar, derbyclient.jar</b> jar files to the Java Build Path of the project.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
Enables the Derby features for the project.  The <b>ij</b> and <b>sysinfo</b>
tools are now accessible from the Eclipse menu, and the Apache Derby Network Server can now be started and stopped from within Eclipse. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
Allows Apache Derby properties to be set for the project. 
</li>
</ul>
