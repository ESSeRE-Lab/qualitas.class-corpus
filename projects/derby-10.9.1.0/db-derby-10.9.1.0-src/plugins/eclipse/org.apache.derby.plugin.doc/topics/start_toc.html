</head>

<h2>Getting Started with the Derby plug-ins for Eclipse</h2>
<p>
The Apache Derby plug-ins for Eclipse provide a seamless integration between 
Eclipse and Apache Derby. It enables the use of the Derby database JAR files 
as an installable component to Eclipse. Additionally the ij SQL scripting tool 
and the Apache Derby Network Server can be run from the Eclipse console.
</p>
<p>
If you are new to Eclipse or Derby, the steps below will get you started 
using both!  At the very least, follow the first four steps to become familiar
with Eclipse and Derby.
<ul>
<li>
Create an <a href="java_project.html">Eclipse Java project.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
Add the <a href="nature.html">Apache Derby nature</a> to your Java project.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
Start the <a href="start_server.html">Derby Network Server.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
Launch <a href="ij.html"><b>ij</b></a> to create and connect to a 
Derby database.  <b>ij</b> is the Derby tool you can use to issue SQL commands 
against the database.

<br/>
</li>
<li>
Run entire <a href="ij2.html">SQL scripts</a> against the database using ij.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>

Create a <a href="derby_app.html">Java application</a> which accesses a Derby database.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
Shutdown the <a href="stop_server.html">Derby Network Server.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
Obtain Java and Derby information to help in troubleshooting problems using 
<a href="sysinfo.html">sysinfo.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
